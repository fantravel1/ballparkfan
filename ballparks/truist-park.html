        <!-- What Makes Truist Park Special -->
        <div class="content-block" id="park-heading">
          <h2>What Makes Truist Park Special</h2>
          <p>Truist Park does something no other ballpark in Major League Baseball has pulled off quite as well: it turned the entire surrounding area into the attraction. The Battery Atlanta, a sprawling 1.5-million-square-foot mixed-use entertainment district, wraps around the ballpark on three sides. Restaurants, bars, shops, a concert venue, a movie theater, a hotel -- all of it steps from the gates and open year-round. On game days, The Battery fills up hours before first pitch and stays alive long after the final out. The idea was that attending a Braves game should feel like an entire evening out, not just a three-hour sit in a seat, and they nailed it.</p>
          <p>Inside the park, the design blends modern comforts with a distinctly Southern warmth. The concourses are wide and open, with sightlines to the field from almost everywhere. The Hank Aaron Terrace in the outfield offers a social gathering space with standing room, group areas, and premium food options -- all with a view of the game. It is named, of course, for the all-time great who spent the prime of his career as a Brave and broke Babe Ruth's home run record in Atlanta in 1974.</p>
          <p>Beyond the outfield, Monument Garden honors the greatest players in franchise history with bronze sculptures and detailed plaques. Walking through it, you feel the weight of a franchise that spans three cities -- Boston, Milwaukee, and Atlanta -- and more than a century of baseball. Hank Aaron, Eddie Mathews, Warren Spahn, Greg Maddux, Tom Glavine, John Smoltz, Chipper Jones -- the names read like a Hall of Fame all on their own.</p>
          <p>And then there is 2021. The Braves won the World Series that year, bringing a championship back to Atlanta for the first time since 1995. Truist Park, barely four years old at the time, became the stage for one of the most dramatic postseason runs in recent memory. The gold-trimmed World Series banners and the trophy display inside the park are a reminder that this is not just a pretty venue -- it is a place where history was made.</p>

        <!-- Getting There -->
        <div class="content-block">
          <h2>Getting There</h2>
          <h3>MARTA Shuttle</h3>
          <p>Truist Park does not have direct MARTA rail access -- the ballpark is in Cobb County, outside the rail system's reach. On game days, the Braves operate a shuttle bus from the Arts Center MARTA station (Red and Gold lines) to The Battery. The shuttle runs before and after games for a small fee. It is the best public transit option, but plan for extra travel time, especially on weekend games when demand is high.</p>

          <h3>Driving</h3>
          <p>Most fans drive to Truist Park. The stadium is located at the intersection of I-285 and I-75, two of the busiest interstate highways in the Southeast. On game days, traffic on both interstates can be brutal -- allow significantly more time than your GPS suggests. Approach from I-285 West when possible to avoid the worst of the I-75 northbound congestion.</p>

          <h3>Parking</h3>
          <p>Truist Park offers ample parking in structured garages and surface lots surrounding The Battery. Prices vary by proximity, with most lots running $20 to $40 on game days. Pre-purchasing a parking pass through the Braves app or a third-party parking service is strongly recommended -- it saves time and guarantees a spot. Once you park in The Battery area, everything is walkable.</p>

          <h3>Rideshare</h3>
          <p>Uber and Lyft have designated drop-off and pickup zones near The Battery. After the game, expect surge pricing and significant waits as thousands of fans request rides at the same time. If you can linger at a Battery restaurant for 30 to 45 minutes after the final out, the surge subsides and the pickup experience improves dramatically.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Fan Tips -->
        <div class="content-block">
          <h2>Fan Tips</h2>
          <div class="tip-box">
            <p class="tip-box__label">Arrive Early to Explore The Battery</p>
            <p>The Battery Atlanta is half the experience. Arrive at least two hours before first pitch to walk the district, grab a pre-game meal, and enjoy the atmosphere. The restaurants and bars fill up fast on weekend games, so earlier is better. Live music often plays on the outdoor stages before the gates open, giving the whole area a festival energy that you will miss if you show up at game time.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="tip-box">
            <p class="tip-box__label">Waffle House Inside the Park</p>
            <p>Yes, really -- there is a Waffle House concession stand inside Truist Park, the only one in any MLB stadium. Located on the first-base side, it serves a limited menu of Waffle House classics including their signature waffles and hash browns. For anyone from the South, it is practically a pilgrimage. Lines get long, especially in the middle innings, so visit early or late for a shorter wait.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="tip-box">
            <p class="tip-box__label">Chop House for Premium Views</p>
            <p>The Chop House is a full-service restaurant built into the left field area of Truist Park with floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking the field. You can watch the game while eating a sit-down meal -- steaks, burgers, craft cocktails -- without leaving your table. Reservations fill up quickly on popular game days, so book well in advance through the Braves website. Even if you do not have a reservation, the standing area near the Chop House offers some of the best casual viewing spots in the park.</p>

        <!-- Honest Drawbacks -->
        <div class="content-block">
          <h2>Honest Drawbacks</h2>
          <div class="drawback-box">
            <p class="drawback-box__label">Suburban Location</p>
            <p>Truist Park is in Cobb County, not in Atlanta proper. Unlike ballparks embedded in city neighborhoods -- Wrigley in Wrigleyville, Fenway in the Fenway-Kenmore neighborhood -- Truist Park sits in a suburban area off the interstate. The Battery does an impressive job creating a walkable environment once you arrive, but getting there requires a car or rideshare for most visitors. There is no urban neighborhood to wander through, no side streets full of dive bars and local character. The vibe, for better or worse, is more curated than organic.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="drawback-box">
            <p class="drawback-box__label">No Direct MARTA Access</p>
            <p>The lack of direct MARTA rail service is the single biggest complaint about Truist Park. Fans staying in downtown Atlanta or near the airport cannot hop on a train and walk to the game the way you can at most urban ballparks. The shuttle from Arts Center station helps, but it adds time and complexity. For a metro area the size of Atlanta, not having rail access to the ballpark is a significant drawback.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="drawback-box">
            <p class="drawback-box__label">Interstate Traffic</p>
            <p>I-75 and I-285 are notoriously congested highways on a normal day. On game days, the traffic around Truist Park can be genuinely brutal, especially for weeknight games when rush hour and the pre-game influx collide. Budget an extra 30 to 60 minutes beyond what your GPS tells you, and leave early. Post-game traffic getting out of the parking garages and back onto the interstate can take just as long.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="drawback-box">
            <p class="drawback-box__label">The Battery Can Feel Like a Mall</p>
            <p>The Battery Atlanta is polished, well-maintained, and full of options -- but some fans find it feels more like an upscale outdoor shopping mall than a genuine neighborhood. Everything was built at once, by one developer, with a cohesive corporate design. It lacks the grit, history, and randomness of an actual city neighborhood surrounding a ballpark. If you prefer the authenticity of Wrigleyville or the chaos of Lansdowne Street outside Fenway, The Battery may feel a bit too sanitized.</p>
