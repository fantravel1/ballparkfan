        <!-- What Makes PNC Park Special -->
        <div class="content-block" id="park-heading">
          <h2>What Makes PNC Park Special</h2>
          <p>Ask any baseball fan to name the most beautiful ballpark in America and PNC Park will be the answer more often than not. It is not even close. Sitting on the north bank of the Allegheny River, PNC Park uses the entire Pittsburgh skyline as its outfield backdrop -- a panorama of bridges, skyscrapers, and river that no other stadium in professional sports can match.</p>
          <p>The experience starts before you even reach the gates. On game days, the Roberto Clemente Bridge -- the iconic yellow suspension bridge connecting downtown to the North Shore -- closes to vehicle traffic and becomes a pedestrian-only walkway. Thousands of fans stream across the river on foot, the park growing larger with every step. It is one of the great pre-game rituals in all of baseball.</p>
          <p>Inside, PNC Park is intentionally intimate. At just 38,747 seats, it is one of the smallest parks in the majors, and that is entirely by design. Every seat feels close to the field. The sightlines are superb. The open concourses along the outfield let you watch the game while grabbing food, with the river and city skyline always visible beyond the outfield fence.</p>
          <p>Right field features the Clemente Wall, standing 21 feet high -- a tribute to Roberto Clemente's iconic number 21. Beyond the wall, the Allegheny River awaits, where kayakers and boaters gather on game days hoping to snag a home run ball. It is a scene unlike anything else in baseball.</p>
          <p>PNC Park proves that a ballpark does not need 50,000 seats or a retractable roof to be great. It just needs the right setting, the right scale, and respect for the game.</p>

        <!-- Local Travel & Nearby Attractions -->
        <div class="content-block">
          <h2>Local Travel &amp; Nearby Attractions</h2>
          <p>Pittsburgh is a seriously underrated travel city, and PNC Park sits in the middle of some of its best attractions. Here are the spots worth building your trip around.</p>

          <div class="travel-card">
            <h3 class="travel-card__title">Roberto Clemente Bridge</h3>
            <p class="travel-card__distance">Steps away</p>
            <p class="travel-card__desc">Walk from downtown across the Allegheny River on this iconic yellow suspension bridge. On game days it closes to vehicle traffic and becomes a pedestrian-only promenade packed with fans. It is the signature approach to PNC Park and one of the best pre-game experiences in baseball.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="travel-card">
            <h3 class="travel-card__title">Mount Washington &amp; Duquesne Incline</h3>
            <p class="travel-card__distance">2 miles</p>
            <p class="travel-card__desc">Ride the Duquesne Incline, a funicular railway operating since 1877, to the top of Mount Washington for the most photographed view in Pittsburgh. The overlook delivers a jaw-dropping panorama of the three rivers, downtown skyline, and PNC Park itself. Go at sunset for the best light.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="travel-card">
            <h3 class="travel-card__title">Andy Warhol Museum</h3>
            <p class="travel-card__distance">0.3 miles</p>
            <p class="travel-card__desc">The world's largest collection of Andy Warhol art, spanning seven floors in a renovated warehouse on the North Shore. Pittsburgh was Warhol's hometown, and this museum covers everything from his early commercial illustrations to the iconic pop art. A perfect pre-game stop just a short walk from the park.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="travel-card">
            <h3 class="travel-card__title">Strip District</h3>
            <p class="travel-card__distance">1 mile</p>
            <p class="travel-card__desc">Pittsburgh's legendary food market district. Visit the original Primanti Brothers for the famous sandwich with fries and coleslaw piled inside, browse Penn Mac for imported cheeses and pasta, and sample food from the ethnic vendors lining Penn Avenue. Best on Saturday mornings, but great any day.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="travel-card">
            <h3 class="travel-card__title">Point State Park</h3>
            <p class="travel-card__distance">1 mile</p>
            <p class="travel-card__desc">The dramatic tip of Pittsburgh's Golden Triangle where the Allegheny and Monongahela rivers merge to form the Ohio. The park features a massive fountain at the point, the Fort Pitt Museum, and green space perfect for a walk before or after the game. A geographic landmark unlike any other American city.</p>

        <!-- Getting There -->
        <div class="content-block">
          <h2>Getting There</h2>
          <h3>Walk Across the Clemente Bridge</h3>
          <p>The best way to reach PNC Park is on foot from downtown Pittsburgh. The Roberto Clemente Bridge (Sixth Street Bridge) drops you right at the home plate entrance. The bridge closes to cars on game days, so the walk is safe, scenic, and unforgettable. Allow 10 minutes from Market Square.</p>

          <h3>T Light Rail</h3>
          <p>Pittsburgh's T light rail system serves the North Shore with two stations near PNC Park: Allegheny Station and North Side Station. Both are within a short walk of the ballpark gates. The T is free within downtown Pittsburgh, making it an easy and affordable option from the South Side or Station Square.</p>

          <h3>Bus Routes</h3>
          <p>Several Port Authority bus routes serve the North Shore. Routes along Federal Street drop you within a block of the park. Check the Port Authority of Allegheny County website for game-day schedules and special event service.</p>

          <h3>Driving &amp; Parking</h3>
          <p>Multiple parking lots and garages surround PNC Park on the North Shore. Expect to pay $20 to $40 on game days depending on proximity. For cheaper options, park downtown or on the South Side and walk across a bridge. Arriving early is worth it -- the North Shore fills up fast.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Fan Tips -->
        <div class="content-block">
          <h2>Fan Tips</h2>
          <div class="tip-box">
            <p class="tip-box__label">Insider Tips</p>
            <p>Walk across the Roberto Clemente Bridge before the game -- it is the single best pre-game experience in all of baseball. Arrive early enough to soak it in. Inside the park, Manny's BBQ is the must-try food spot with slow-smoked pulled pork and brisket that rivals standalone barbecue restaurants. For the best views, sit along the first-base side where the Pittsburgh skyline fills the backdrop beyond the outfield. And do not overlook the value: PNC Park is one of the most affordable ballparks in the majors, with upper-deck tickets often available for under $15.</p>
          </div>

        <!-- Honest Drawbacks -->
        <div class="content-block">
          <h2>Honest Drawbacks</h2>
          <div class="drawback-box">
            <p class="drawback-box__label">Worth Knowing</p>
            <p>The Pirates have struggled competitively for much of the past two decades, which means the atmosphere on a random Tuesday night can feel quiet compared to parks in bigger-market cities. The North Shore area immediately around PNC Park is still developing -- there is no dense neighborhood of bars and restaurants within walking distance the way you find around Wrigley Field or Fenway Park. Nightlife options are limited on the North Shore itself, so plan to head back across a bridge to downtown or the South Side for post-game drinks.</p>
