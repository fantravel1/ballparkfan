        <!-- What Makes Coors Field Special -->
        <div class="content-block">
          <h2>What Makes Coors Field Special</h2>
          <p>Coors Field is the only ballpark in Major League Baseball where the ball genuinely plays by different rules. Sitting at exactly 5,280 feet above sea level — one mile high — the air in Denver is roughly 15 percent thinner than at sea-level stadiums. That means fly balls carry farther here than at any other park in baseball. A routine fly-out at Yankee Stadium or Fenway can clear the fence at Coors. A well-hit drive that might land in the warning track elsewhere can sail into the upper deck in Denver. The result is a park that produces more offense, more home runs, and more chaos than anywhere else in the sport, and visiting pitchers have dreaded road trips to Colorado since the day the park opened in 1995.</p>
          <p>The most distinctive visual feature is the purple row. Every seat in the stadium is forest green — except for Row 20 of the upper deck, which is painted entirely purple. That single row marks the exact elevation of one mile above sea level. It has become one of the most photographed landmarks in baseball, and fans make a point of sitting there at least once just to say they watched a game from a mile high. The views from the upper deck are spectacular in their own right: on a clear day, you can see the snow-capped peaks of the Rocky Mountains stretching across the western horizon beyond the outfield, a backdrop that no other park in baseball can match.</p>
          <p>Beyond the altitude, Coors Field benefits enormously from its location in LoDo — Lower Downtown Denver. The neighborhood surrounding the park is a historic brick warehouse district that has been transformed into one of the best ballpark neighborhoods in baseball. Craft breweries, restaurants, and bars line the streets within a few blocks of the gates. The rooftop bar area in right field, known as The Rooftop, offers a party atmosphere with views of both the field and the mountains. Denver's craft beer culture is legendary, and Coors Field leans into it with one of the deepest beer selections of any stadium in the majors — dozens of Colorado craft breweries are represented on tap throughout the park. It is, in every sense, a ballpark that could only exist in this city.</p>

            <h3 class="travel-card__title">LoDo (Lower Downtown)</h3>
            <p class="travel-card__distance">Steps away &middot; Historic District</p>
            <p class="travel-card__desc">Coors Field sits on the edge of LoDo, Denver's historic brick warehouse district that has been transformed into the city's premier entertainment neighborhood. Within a few blocks of the park you will find dozens of craft breweries, cocktail bars, farm-to-table restaurants, and independent shops. The area is anchored by beautifully preserved 19th-century brick buildings and is easily walkable. On game days, the neighborhood buzzes with energy as fans spill out of bars and restaurants on the way to the gates. Union Station anchors the western end of LoDo.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="travel-card">
            <h3 class="travel-card__title">Denver Union Station</h3>
            <p class="travel-card__distance">0.3 miles &middot; Transit &amp; Dining</p>
            <p class="travel-card__desc">One of the most beautifully restored transit hubs in America. Originally opened in 1881, Denver Union Station is a stunning Beaux-Arts building that now houses upscale restaurants, cocktail bars, boutique shops, and The Crawford Hotel. The Great Hall features a soaring ceiling and serves as both a working transit hub — connecting RTD light rail, bus, and Amtrak lines — and a gathering place for locals and visitors. It is an easy walk from Coors Field and a perfect pre-game or post-game stop.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="travel-card">
            <h3 class="travel-card__title">Red Rocks Amphitheatre</h3>
            <p class="travel-card__distance">15 miles &middot; Concert Venue &amp; Nature</p>
            <p class="travel-card__desc">One of the most famous outdoor concert venues on Earth, Red Rocks is a naturally formed amphitheatre carved into towering red sandstone formations in the foothills west of Denver. Even if there is no concert scheduled during your visit, the park is free to enter during the day and offers hiking trails, stunning geology, and panoramic views of the plains below. The acoustics are legendary, and catching a show here on an off-day from a Rockies series is a bucket-list experience.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="travel-card">
            <h3 class="travel-card__title">Denver Art Museum</h3>
            <p class="travel-card__distance">1 mile &middot; Art &amp; Culture</p>
            <p class="travel-card__desc">A world-class art museum housed in a striking angular building designed by Daniel Libeskind, with an older wing by Gio Ponti. The collection spans global art with particular strength in Western American art, Native American art, and pre-Columbian works. The architecture alone is worth the visit — the Libeskind building juts out at dramatic angles like a geometric crystal. A strong option for a morning or afternoon before a night game, and an easy walk south from LoDo through downtown.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="travel-card">
            <h3 class="travel-card__title">Rocky Mountain National Park</h3>
            <p class="travel-card__distance">65 miles &middot; National Park &amp; Day Trip</p>
            <p class="travel-card__desc">If you have an off-day during a Rockies series, Rocky Mountain National Park is one of the most spectacular day trips in America. Trail Ridge Road climbs above 12,000 feet through alpine tundra with jaw-dropping mountain views. The park is home to elk herds, alpine lakes, wildflower meadows, and hundreds of miles of hiking trails. The drive from Denver takes about 90 minutes and passes through the charming mountain town of Estes Park. Arrive early in the morning to beat the crowds and secure a timed entry reservation during peak season.</p>

        <!-- Getting There -->
        <div class="content-block">
          <h2>Getting There</h2>
          <h3>RTD Light Rail</h3>
          <p>Denver's RTD light rail system connects directly to Union Station, which is a short walk from Coors Field. Multiple light rail lines converge at Union Station, making it easy to reach the park from most parts of the metro area, including Denver International Airport via the A Line. From Union Station, Coors Field is about a five-minute walk east along the 16th Street Mall or Blake Street. This is the easiest and least stressful way to get to a game.</p>
          <h3>Walking from LoDo</h3>
          <p>If you are staying in or visiting downtown Denver, Coors Field is easily walkable from most of LoDo, the 16th Street Mall, and the central business district. The walk from Union Station is pleasant and flat, passing through the heart of the warehouse district. Many fans make a night of it by starting at a LoDo brewery or restaurant and walking to the park from there. The neighborhood is safe, well-lit, and energetic on game days.</p>
          <h3>Parking</h3>
          <p>Several large parking lots line Blake Street and the surrounding blocks near Coors Field. Prices on game days typically range from $15 to $30 depending on proximity. The lots along Blake Street fill up fast, so arriving early helps. There are also parking garages throughout downtown Denver within walking distance. Pre-booking through a parking app is recommended for weekend and marquee games.</p>
          <h3>Rideshare</h3>
          <p>Uber and Lyft are widely used in Denver. Drop-off zones are available near the park, and the flat grid of LoDo streets makes pickup and drop-off relatively straightforward compared to some ballparks. After the game, expect a short wait and mild surge pricing. Walking a few blocks away from the immediate ballpark area will cut your wait time significantly.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Fan Tips -->
        <div class="content-block">
          <h2>Fan Tips</h2>
          <div class="tip-box">
            <p class="tip-box__label">The Purple Row</p>
            <p>Sit in Row 20 of the upper deck at least once in your life. It is the only row of seats painted purple in the entire stadium, marking the exact elevation of one mile above sea level — 5,280 feet. The seats are high up and far from the field, but the novelty and the panoramic mountain views make it an experience every baseball fan should have. Buy tickets specifically for the purple row if you can, or at least walk up to take a photo.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="tip-box">
            <p class="tip-box__label">Rocky Mountain Oysters</p>
            <p>If you dare, try the Rocky Mountain oysters — deep-fried bull testicles that are a genuine Colorado delicacy and available at the park. They are breaded, fried, and served with dipping sauce, and they taste better than you expect. Even if you do not eat them, ordering them for the reaction of your friends is worth the price. This is one of those only-at-Coors experiences that you will not find at any other ballpark.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="tip-box">
            <p class="tip-box__label">Craft Beer Selection</p>
            <p>Coors Field has one of the best beer selections in all of baseball, and that is not hyperbole. Colorado is one of the top craft beer states in the country, and the park showcases it. Look for stands featuring local breweries like Odell, New Belgium, Great Divide, and Breckenridge. The Sandlot Brewery, located inside the stadium, actually brews beer on-site — one of the only in-stadium craft breweries in professional sports. Do not default to the mass-market options; explore the local taps.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="tip-box">
            <p class="tip-box__label">Stay Hydrated at Altitude</p>
            <p>Denver's mile-high elevation means the air is drier and you dehydrate faster than you realize, especially if you are visiting from a lower elevation. Drink plenty of water throughout the game — more than you think you need. Alcohol hits harder at altitude, so pace yourself with the excellent craft beer. Bring sunscreen as well; the sun is noticeably more intense at 5,280 feet, and you will burn faster than at a sea-level park.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <!-- Honest Drawbacks -->
        <div class="content-block">
          <h2>Honest Drawbacks</h2>
          <div class="drawback-box">
            <p class="drawback-box__label">Altitude Affects Visitors</p>
            <p>If you are visiting from sea level or a low-elevation city, you will likely feel the altitude. Shortness of breath, headaches, and fatigue are common for visitors who are not acclimated. Drink significantly more water than you normally would, go easy on alcohol for the first day or two, and do not be surprised if walking up to the upper deck leaves you more winded than expected. It is not dangerous for most people, but it is noticeable and can take the edge off your energy if you are not prepared.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="drawback-box">
            <p class="drawback-box__label">Intense Sun at Elevation</p>
            <p>At 5,280 feet, you are significantly closer to the sun with less atmospheric protection. UV exposure at Coors Field is measurably higher than at sea-level parks, and sunburn happens fast — even on partly cloudy days. Day games and afternoon start times can be brutal without sunscreen, a hat, and sunglasses. The dry air compounds the effect. Do not underestimate the Colorado sun, especially if you are fair-skinned or coming from a humid climate where overcast skies offer more natural protection.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="drawback-box">
            <p class="drawback-box__label">Upper Deck Is Very High</p>
            <p>Coors Field has a seating capacity of over 50,000, and the upper deck reflects that scale. The highest seats are genuinely far from the field — among the most remote upper-deck seats in baseball. If you are sitting in the nosebleeds, the players look small and the game feels distant. The mountain views partially compensate, but if being close to the action matters to you, spend the extra money for lower-level seats. The upper deck is best experienced once for the purple row novelty, not as a regular game-day seat.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="drawback-box">
            <p class="drawback-box__label">High-Scoring Slugfests</p>
            <p>The thin air means games at Coors Field often turn into offensive marathons. Scores of 10-8 and 12-9 are not unusual, and pitching duels are rare. While some fans love the fireworks, the high-scoring affairs also tend to drag on — games at Coors Field are historically among the longest in baseball by time of game. A three-and-a-half-hour game is common, and four-hour games are not uncommon. If you prefer tight, quick pitching duels, Coors may test your patience.</p>

The rooftop area in right field, called The Rooftop, has a bar atmosphere with great views and solid food options including barbecue and street tacos.</p>
