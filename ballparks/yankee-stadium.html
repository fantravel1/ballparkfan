        <!-- What Makes Yankee Stadium Special -->
        <div class="content-block">
          <h2>What Makes Yankee Stadium Special</h2>
          <p>Yankee Stadium is not just a ballpark — it is the physical manifestation of the most successful franchise in North American professional sports. The New York Yankees have won 27 World Championships, and everywhere you look inside this stadium, that history is present. Banners hang from the upper deck, retired numbers line the outfield walls, and Monument Park sits beyond center field like a hallowed outdoor museum.</p>
          <p>The stadium's most recognizable design element is the limestone frieze that rings the top of the grandstand. It is a deliberate callback to the original Yankee Stadium — the House That Ruth Built — which stood across the street from 1923 to 2008. The original frieze was a copper facade on the roof; the new version is structural concrete, larger and more prominent, connecting the two buildings across nearly a century of history.</p>

          <h3>Monument Park</h3>
          <p>Monument Park is the emotional center of the stadium. Located beyond the center-field fence, it houses monuments, plaques, and retired numbers for the greatest figures in Yankees history. Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Joe DiMaggio, Mickey Mantle, Thurman Munson, Mariano Rivera, Derek Jeter — they are all here. It opens when the gates open, typically 90 minutes before first pitch, and it fills up quickly. Go early.</p>

          <h3>The Great Hall</h3>
          <p>Before you even reach your seat, you walk through the Great Hall — a massive interior concourse behind home plate lined with enormous banners and historical photographs. It functions as both the main entrance and an informal museum, with oversized images of Yankee legends stretching floor to ceiling. It is designed to make you feel the weight of the franchise before the first pitch is thrown.</p>

          <h3>The Yankee Mystique</h3>
          <p>No team in baseball carries the same cultural weight as the Yankees. The interlocking NY logo is one of the most recognized symbols in the world. Pinstripes are more than a uniform — they are an identity. Whether you love the Yankees or despise them, there is no neutral feeling when you walk into this building. The crowd is loud, knowledgeable, and unforgiving. Roll Call in the bleachers, Sinatra's "New York, New York" after wins, and the electric tension of October baseball all create an atmosphere that no other stadium in the sport can replicate.</p>

        <div class="content-block">
          <h2>Local Travel &amp; Nearby Attractions</h2>
          <p>The Bronx often gets dismissed by visitors who never leave Midtown Manhattan. That is a mistake. The neighborhood around Yankee Stadium has some of the best cultural attractions in New York City.</p>

          <div class="travel-card">
            <h3 class="travel-card__title">Bronx Zoo</h3>
            <p class="travel-card__distance">1.5 miles from Yankee Stadium</p>
            <p class="travel-card__desc">The largest urban zoo in the United States, spanning 265 acres with world-class exhibits including the Congo Gorilla Forest, Tiger Mountain, and the Himalayan Highlands. Easily worth a full day before a night game. Take the Bx9 bus or walk through the neighborhood.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="travel-card">
            <h3 class="travel-card__title">New York Botanical Garden</h3>
            <p class="travel-card__distance">2 miles from Yankee Stadium</p>
            <p class="travel-card__desc">A 250-acre living museum featuring the stunning Enid A. Haupt Conservatory, seasonal garden displays, and 50 acres of old-growth forest. The orchid show in spring and the holiday train show in winter are iconic New York experiences. Adjacent to the Bronx Zoo — combine them for an epic Bronx day.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="travel-card">
            <h3 class="travel-card__title">Arthur Avenue / Little Italy of the Bronx</h3>
            <p class="travel-card__distance">1 mile from Yankee Stadium</p>
            <p class="travel-card__desc">Forget Manhattan's tourist-trap Little Italy on Mulberry Street. Arthur Avenue is the real deal — authentic Italian bakeries, delis, butcher shops, and restaurants that have been family-run for generations. Get fresh mozzarella at Casa Della Mozzarella, pastries at Madonia Bakery, and a meal at Roberto's or Tra Di Noi. This is one of the best food neighborhoods in all five boroughs.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="travel-card">
            <h3 class="travel-card__title">Yankee Stadium Heritage / Original Site</h3>
            <p class="travel-card__distance">0.2 miles from Yankee Stadium</p>
            <p class="travel-card__desc">Heritage Field sits on the exact footprint of the original Yankee Stadium, directly across East 161st Street from the current ballpark. The site is now a public park with youth baseball fields. Walk the perimeter and imagine the roar of 70,000 fans watching Ruth, Gehrig, and Mantle. Historical markers and plaques note the original home plate and monument locations.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="travel-card">
            <h3 class="travel-card__title">Manhattan via Subway</h3>
            <p class="travel-card__distance">25 minutes from Yankee Stadium</p>
            <p class="travel-card__desc">The 4, B, and D trains connect Yankee Stadium directly to Midtown Manhattan. You can be in Times Square, Grand Central Terminal, or the Upper West Side in 20-25 minutes. Postgame, expect a packed platform — let one or two trains pass and the crowd thins quickly.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <!-- Getting There -->
        <div class="content-block">
          <h2>Getting There</h2>

          <h3>NYC Subway (Recommended)</h3>
          <p>The easiest way to reach Yankee Stadium is via the NYC Subway. Take the <strong>4 train</strong> (Lexington Avenue line, east side of Manhattan) or the <strong>B or D trains</strong> (Sixth Avenue line, west side of Manhattan) to <strong>161st Street-Yankee Stadium</strong>. The station exits directly onto River Avenue at the stadium's Gate 4 entrance. From Midtown, the ride takes about 20-25 minutes. On game days, trains run extra service.</p>

          <h3>Metro-North Railroad</h3>
          <p>Metro-North operates the <strong>Yankees-East 153rd Street</strong> station on game days, a short walk from the stadium. This is convenient for fans coming from the northern suburbs (Westchester, Connecticut) or from Grand Central Terminal. Check the MTA website for the game-day schedule — service only operates around event times.</p>

          <h3>Driving &amp; Parking</h3>
          <p>If you must drive, several parking garages surround the stadium, but expect to pay $35-55 on game days. Traffic on the Major Deegan Expressway (I-87) and the Cross Bronx Expressway backs up significantly before and after games. The subway is genuinely better. If you do drive, arrive at least 90 minutes early to secure parking and avoid the worst congestion.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Fan Tips -->
        <div class="content-block">
          <h2>Fan Tips</h2>
          <div class="tip-box">
            <p class="tip-box__label">Insider Tips</p>
            <p>Visit Monument Park early. Gates typically open 90 minutes before first pitch, and Monument Park closes 45 minutes before the game starts. That gives you a narrow window — get there when gates open or you will miss it.</p>
            <p>The best food in the stadium is Lobel's steak sandwich, a thick-cut prime steak on a roll behind Section 20. It is expensive, but it is the one concession item that justifies the ballpark markup. City Winery for wine drinkers and Mighty Quinn's for brisket are also worth seeking out.</p>
            <p>For atmosphere, sit in the bleachers. Section 203 is the heart of the Bleacher Creatures, who do Roll Call at the start of every game — chanting each player's name until they acknowledge the crowd. It is one of the great traditions in all of baseball, and it only happens here.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <!-- Honest Drawbacks -->
        <div class="content-block">
          <h2>Honest Drawbacks</h2>
          <div class="drawback-box">
            <p class="drawback-box__label">What could be better</p>
            <p>Everything at Yankee Stadium is expensive. Beer, food, lower-level tickets — the prices reflect the Yankees brand, and there is no getting around it. Budget accordingly or stick to the upper deck and bring your appetite from Arthur Avenue.</p>
            <p>The Bronx location can feel remote and unfamiliar to visitors, especially at night. The immediate neighborhood around the stadium is not a dining or nightlife destination the way Wrigleyville or the Fenway area are. You come to the stadium, watch the game, and leave.</p>
            <p>The concourses and premium areas can feel corporate and sterile — more luxury hotel than baseball cathedral. The original Yankee Stadium had a gritty, lived-in energy that the new building, for all its polish, does not fully capture. The history is real, but the building itself is only from 2009, and sometimes it shows.</p>

              <summary>Is Yankee Stadium the original House That Ruth Built?</summary>
              <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>No. The current Yankee Stadium opened in 2009 and is located directly across East 161st Street from where the original Yankee Stadium stood from 1923 to 2008. The original was nicknamed "The House That Ruth Built" because Babe Ruth's star power drove the Yankees to build their own grand stadium. The current stadium incorporates design elements from the original, most notably the signature limestone frieze along the roofline and the Monument Park tradition. The original stadium's footprint is now Heritage Field, a public park and youth baseball complex you can visit before the game.</p>

            <details class="faq-item">
              <summary>What is Monument Park at Yankee Stadium?</summary>
              <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>Monument Park is an open-air museum beyond the center-field fence honoring the greatest players and figures in Yankees history. It contains full monuments for legends like Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Joe DiMaggio, and Mickey Mantle, along with retired number plaques for players including Mariano Rivera, Derek Jeter, Yogi Berra, and Whitey Ford. Monument Park opens when stadium gates open — typically 90 minutes before first pitch — and closes 45 minutes before game time. Access is free with a game ticket. Get there early, as the area is small and fills up fast.</p>

              <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>Take the NYC Subway to the 161st Street-Yankee Stadium station, served by the 4, B, and D lines.

From Midtown Manhattan, the ride takes approximately 20-25 minutes. The station exits directly at the stadium. On game days, the MTA runs additional train service. Metro-North Railroad also operates a Yankees-East 153rd Street station with game-day-only service from Grand Central Terminal.</p>
