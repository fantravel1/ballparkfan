        <!-- What Makes Globe Life Field Special -->
        <div class="content-block">
          <h2>What Makes Globe Life Field Special</h2>
          <p>Globe Life Field exists because of one simple, unavoidable reality: Texas heat is brutal, and it was killing the fan experience at the old ballpark. The Rangers' previous home, Globe Life Park, was an open-air stadium where summer afternoon games meant sitting in 105-degree heat with no shade and no escape. Attendance cratered during the hottest months. Globe Life Field solved that problem completely. The retractable roof and full air conditioning system make this the most climate-controlled ballpark in Major League Baseball, and it transforms summer baseball in Arlington from an endurance test into something genuinely comfortable.</p>

          <h3>The Newest Park in MLB</h3>
          <p>Opening in 2020, Globe Life Field is the newest ballpark in the major leagues. The design is modern, sleek, and unapologetically big — everything here is Texas-sized. The concourses are wide and open, the video boards are massive, and the amenities reflect the latest thinking in stadium design. From the moment you walk through the gates, the park feels polished and contemporary in a way that older retro-classic parks simply do not.</p>

          <h3>2023 World Series Home</h3>
          <p>Globe Life Field earned its place in baseball history as the home of the 2023 World Series champion Texas Rangers. The Rangers' dominant October run — capped by a five-game victory over the Arizona Diamondbacks — gave the franchise its first championship and christened the new stadium with a moment fans had waited decades to see. The energy inside the park during that postseason was electric, and it cemented Globe Life Field as a venue capable of hosting the biggest moments in the sport.</p>

          <h3>Modern Amenities and Texas-Sized Everything</h3>
          <p>The park delivers on modern comforts. The seating bowl is designed to keep fans close to the field, the food and beverage options are extensive, and the premium suites and club areas are among the best in baseball. The main video board in left field is one of the largest in the league. The concourses flow naturally, with sightlines to the field from most concession areas so you never feel disconnected from the game while grabbing food or drinks.</p>

          <h3>Transparent Facade</h3>
          <p>One of the most distinctive architectural features of Globe Life Field is its massive transparent facade along the outfield. When the roof is open, natural light floods the interior, and the glass panels give the park a bright, airy feel that prevents it from feeling like a closed-off dome. Even with the roof shut, the translucent panels let daylight filter in, maintaining a connection to the outside world that many enclosed stadiums lack entirely. It is a smart design choice that keeps the park from feeling like a windowless warehouse.</p>

        <div class="content-block">
          <h2>Local Travel &amp; Nearby Attractions</h2>
          <p>Arlington sits in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex, and while the city itself is suburban and car-dependent, the surrounding area offers a surprising amount to see and do. Here are the best spots to pair with your game day.</p>

          <div class="travel-card">
            <h3 class="travel-card__title">AT&amp;T Stadium</h3>
            <p class="travel-card__distance">0.5 miles</p>
            <p class="travel-card__desc">Home of the Dallas Cowboys and one of the most impressive sports venues in the world, AT&amp;T Stadium sits just half a mile from Globe Life Field. The stadium offers year-round tours that take you onto the field, through the locker rooms, and past the enormous center-hung video board that redefined what a Jumbotron could be. The entire Arlington entertainment district between the two stadiums is packed with restaurants, bars, and event spaces, making it easy to combine a Rangers game with a Cowboys stadium visit.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="travel-card">
            <h3 class="travel-card__title">Fort Worth Stockyards</h3>
            <p class="travel-card__distance">25 miles</p>
            <p class="travel-card__desc">The Fort Worth Stockyards are where the Old West is still alive and breathing. Twice daily, real longhorn cattle are driven down East Exchange Avenue by cowboys on horseback — a tradition that has continued since the days when Fort Worth was a major stop on the Chisholm Trail. The district is packed with honky-tonks where live country music plays every night, rodeo arenas hosting regular competitions, Western wear shops, and steakhouses serving some of the best beef in Texas. This is authentic Texas culture, not a theme park version of it.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="travel-card">
            <h3 class="travel-card__title">Dallas Arts District</h3>
            <p class="travel-card__distance">20 miles</p>
            <p class="travel-card__desc">The largest urban arts district in the United States, the Dallas Arts District spans 68 acres of world-class cultural institutions. The Nasher Sculpture Center houses one of the finest collections of modern and contemporary sculpture in the world, set in a serene Renzo Piano-designed building with a stunning outdoor garden. The Dallas Museum of Art is free to enter and features collections spanning 5,000 years of human creativity. Klyde Warren Park, a deck park built over a sunken freeway, connects the district with food trucks, live music, yoga classes, and green space.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="travel-card">
            <h3 class="travel-card__title">Six Flags Over Texas</h3>
            <p class="travel-card__distance">1 mile</p>
            <p class="travel-card__desc">The original Six Flags theme park — the one that started the entire chain — sits right next to Globe Life Field. Opened in 1961, Six Flags Over Texas features dozens of roller coasters, thrill rides, and family attractions spread across a massive park themed around the six nations that have governed Texas. If you are traveling with kids or just love coasters, combining a day at Six Flags with an evening Rangers game is one of the best double-header entertainment experiences in all of baseball.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="travel-card">
            <h3 class="travel-card__title">Sundance Square, Fort Worth</h3>
            <p class="travel-card__distance">25 miles</p>
            <p class="travel-card__desc">Sundance Square is a vibrant 35-block entertainment district in the heart of downtown Fort Worth. The pedestrian-friendly area is anchored by a beautifully designed public plaza and surrounded by restaurants, rooftop bars, live music venues, theaters, and galleries. Fort Worth has a distinctly different personality from Dallas — more Western, more relaxed, more authentically Texan — and Sundance Square is the best place to experience it. It is well worth the 30-minute drive from Arlington.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <!-- Getting There -->
        <div class="content-block">
          <h2>Getting There</h2>
          <p>There is no sugarcoating this: Globe Life Field is car-dependent. Arlington is the largest city in the United States without a public transit system, and there is no rail line, subway, or bus route that drops you at the ballpark. If you are coming from Dallas or Fort Worth, you will almost certainly need a car or a rideshare to get there.</p>

          <h3>Driving &amp; Parking</h3>
          <p>The vast majority of fans drive to Globe Life Field. The ballpark is located directly off Interstate 30 and is well-signed from every major highway in the metroplex. Massive parking lots surround the stadium and the adjacent AT&amp;T Stadium, with general parking typically ranging from $20 to $40 depending on proximity. Arrive early on weekend games — the lots fill up, and the traffic on Randol Mill Road and Stadium Drive can get congested close to first pitch.</p>

          <h3>Rideshare</h3>
          <p>Uber and Lyft are popular options for getting to the park, especially for fans who want to avoid the parking hassle. Designated rideshare pick-up and drop-off zones are located around the stadium perimeter. Keep in mind that surge pricing is common after games, and wait times can spike when 40,000 fans all request rides at the same time. Budget extra time and patience for the post-game rideshare scramble.</p>

          <h3>TRE Train + Rideshare</h3>
          <p>The closest public transit option is the Trinity Railway Express (TRE), a commuter rail line that runs between Dallas and Fort Worth. Take the TRE to the CentrePort/DFW Airport station, which is about 5 miles from the ballpark, then use a rideshare for the final leg. It is not seamless, but it is a reasonable option if you are staying in downtown Dallas or Fort Worth and want to avoid driving in metroplex traffic entirely.</p>
        </div>

          <h2>Fan Tips</h2>
          <div class="tip-box">
            <p class="tip-box__label">Insider Tips</p>
            <p>The air conditioning is a genuine game-changer during the Texas summer. While the rest of the state melts in triple-digit heat from June through September, you will be watching baseball in climate-controlled comfort inside Globe Life Field. It is the single biggest quality-of-life upgrade in the entire park, and it is the reason the Rangers built the new stadium.</p>
            <p>The brisket nachos are the must-try food item at Globe Life Field. A towering pile of chips loaded with slow-smoked Texas brisket, queso, jalapenos, and barbecue sauce — it is messy, indulgent, and unmistakably Texan. Get them early in the game before the longest lines form.</p>
            <p>Sections behind home plate offer the best views in the park. The seating bowl geometry keeps you close to the action, and the sightlines from the lower bowl behind the plate are excellent. If you can splurge on seats in this area, it is worth every dollar for the perspective on the game.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <!-- Honest Drawbacks -->
        <div class="content-block">
          <h2>Honest Drawbacks</h2>
          <div class="drawback-box">
            <p class="drawback-box__label">Worth Knowing</p>
            <p>There is no public transit to Globe Life Field. Arlington has no rail, no subway, and no meaningful bus service to the ballpark. If you do not have a car, you are entirely dependent on rideshare, and the post-game surge pricing and wait times can be frustrating. This is one of the least transit-accessible ballparks in all of Major League Baseball.</p>
            <p>Arlington is suburban sprawl. Unlike ballparks in walkable urban neighborhoods — think Wrigley Field, Fenway Park, or Petco Park — there is no charming surrounding district to explore on foot. The area around the stadium is parking lots, highways, and chain restaurants. The entertainment district between Globe Life Field and AT&amp;T Stadium is growing, but it still feels more like a planned development than an organic neighborhood.</p>
            <p>The artificial turf is a noticeable downgrade from natural grass. The ball bounces differently, the field looks slightly synthetic on television and in person, and purists will always prefer the real thing. The Rangers chose turf for practical reasons — maintaining real grass under a closed roof in the Texas heat is extremely difficult — but it is a compromise that some fans feel keenly.</p>
            <p>Globe Life Field can feel sterile compared to older venues. It is brand new, spotlessly clean, and loaded with modern amenities, but it lacks the quirks, the history, and the lived-in character of parks like Fenway, Wrigley, or even PNC Park. Some fans describe it as more of a convention center than a ballpark. The franchise is still building its memories here, and time will help, but the park does not yet have the soul that comes with decades of history.</p>
