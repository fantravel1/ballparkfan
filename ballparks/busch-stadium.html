      <!-- What Makes Busch Stadium Special -->
      <section class="content-block" aria-labelledby="what-makes-special">
        <h2 id="what-makes-special">What Makes Busch Stadium Special</h2>
        <p>Busch Stadium is the heart of baseball in the Midwest. Opened in 2006 in downtown St. Louis, it replaced its predecessor just across the street and immediately established itself as one of the finest ballparks in the National League. It is a place where tradition, passion, and the unmistakable silhouette of the Gateway Arch come together every game day.</p>

        <h3>The Gateway Arch Beyond Center Field</h3>
        <p>No ballpark view in baseball rivals the sight of the Gateway Arch rising 630 feet above the St. Louis skyline, visible beyond center field from seats throughout the stadium. At sunset, the stainless steel monument catches the light and glows against the Missouri sky. At night, it is illuminated and frames every pitch with a backdrop that reminds you exactly where you are. It is a view that belongs on every baseball fan's bucket list.</p>

        <h3>The Best Fans in Baseball</h3>
        <p>The phrase sparks debate across the sport, but the evidence is hard to argue with. Cardinals fans consistently fill Busch Stadium regardless of the team's record. The knowledge runs deep here. Fans in St. Louis understand the game, respect opposing players with genuine applause for great plays, and pass their love of the Cardinals from generation to generation. The atmosphere is intense but welcoming, competitive but gracious. Visiting fans routinely describe Busch Stadium as one of the friendliest parks they have ever attended.</p>

        <h3>Ballpark Village</h3>
        <p>Adjacent to the stadium, Ballpark Village is a dining, entertainment, and sports complex that has transformed the game-day experience. It includes the Cardinals Hall of Fame and Museum, rooftop viewing areas that look directly into the stadium, restaurants, bars, and live music venues. It buzzes with energy before, during, and after games, and gives fans a reason to arrive early and stay late.</p>

        <h3>The Stan Musial Statue</h3>
        <p>The bronze statue of Stan "The Man" Musial stands outside the stadium at the third-base entrance, capturing the Hall of Famer's iconic batting stance. Musial played 22 seasons for the Cardinals, won three MVP awards and three World Series titles, and remains the greatest player in franchise history. The statue is a pilgrimage site for Cardinals fans and a gathering point before every game. Touch the bat for good luck. Everyone does.</p>

        <h3>A Red Sea of Cardinals Jerseys</h3>
        <p>Walk into Busch Stadium on any game day and you will see a wave of red that stretches from the field level to the upper deck. Cardinals fans wear their colors with pride, and the visual effect is stunning. Home whites, road grays, throwback powder blues, Musial jerseys, Molina jerseys, Pujols jerseys — the red sea is one of the most distinctive sights in all of baseball and a testament to how deeply this city loves its team.</p>

        <h3>Eleven World Series Titles</h3>
        <p>The St. Louis Cardinals have won eleven World Series championships, second only to the New York Yankees in baseball history. That tradition hangs over every game at Busch Stadium. Championship banners line the upper deck, retired numbers dot the outfield wall, and the echoes of Ozzie Smith's backflips, Bob Gibson's dominance, and David Freese's miracle in 2011 are woven into the fabric of the place. This is a franchise that expects to win, and the stadium reflects that standard.</p>

        <h2 id="nearby-attractions">Local Travel &amp; Nearby Attractions</h2>
        <p>St. Louis is an underrated baseball trip city with world-class attractions, most of them free. Busch Stadium sits in the heart of downtown, making it easy to explore the city on foot or by transit.</p>

        <div class="travel-card">
          <h3 class="travel-card__title">Gateway Arch &amp; Museum</h3>
          <p class="travel-card__distance">0.3 miles</p>
          <p class="travel-card__desc">The 630-foot Gateway Arch is the tallest man-made monument in the United States and the defining symbol of St. Louis. Take the tram ride to the top for breathtaking views of the city and the Mississippi River stretching to the horizon. Below the Arch, the Museum of Westward Expansion tells the story of the Lewis and Clark expedition and America's push toward the Pacific. The grounds along the riverfront are perfect for a pre-game walk. It is all part of the Gateway Arch National Park and well worth a full morning.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="travel-card">
          <h3 class="travel-card__title">Ballpark Village</h3>
          <p class="travel-card__distance">Adjacent</p>
          <p class="travel-card__desc">Directly next to Busch Stadium, Ballpark Village is the premier game-day destination. It features a wide range of dining and entertainment options, the Cardinals Hall of Fame and Museum where you can explore over a century of franchise history, and rooftop venues with views directly into the stadium. On game days the complex is packed with energy. On non-game days it remains a lively entertainment district. If you are visiting Busch Stadium, you will inevitably spend time here.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="travel-card">
          <h3 class="travel-card__title">City Museum</h3>
          <p class="travel-card__distance">2 miles</p>
          <p class="travel-card__desc">The City Museum is unlike anything else you have ever visited. Built inside a repurposed shoe factory, it is a wildly creative maze of caves, tunnels, slides, climbing structures, and art installations made from reclaimed industrial materials. There is a rooftop Ferris wheel, a ten-story slide, and a school bus hanging off the edge of the roof. It defies description and delights visitors of every age. If you visit one non-baseball attraction in St. Louis, make it this one.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="travel-card">
          <h3 class="travel-card__title">Forest Park</h3>
          <p class="travel-card__distance">3 miles</p>
          <p class="travel-card__desc">Forest Park is larger than Central Park in New York and home to an extraordinary collection of free attractions. The Saint Louis Zoo is world-class and completely free. The Saint Louis Art Museum houses masterworks spanning centuries. The Saint Louis Science Center offers interactive exhibits for all ages. The Missouri History Museum rounds out the collection. You could spend an entire day here without paying a dime and still not see everything. It is one of the great urban parks in America.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="travel-card">
          <h3 class="travel-card__title">Anheuser-Busch Brewery</h3>
          <p class="travel-card__distance">1.5 miles</p>
          <p class="travel-card__desc">The historic Anheuser-Busch Brewery in the Soulard neighborhood offers free tours of the sprawling campus where Budweiser has been brewed since 1852. You will see the iconic Clydesdale horses in their ornate brick stable, walk through the beechwood aging cellars, and learn the history of one of America's most famous brands. The tour ends with complimentary tastings in the beer garden. It is a quintessential St. Louis experience, especially on a warm afternoon before a night game.</p>

      <!-- Getting There -->
      <section class="content-block" aria-labelledby="getting-there">
        <h2 id="getting-there">Getting There</h2>
        <p>Busch Stadium sits in the heart of downtown St. Louis, making it accessible by multiple modes of transportation. The MetroLink light rail system is the easiest option: the Stadium station on both the Red and Blue lines drops you steps from the gates. Trains run frequently on game days and the ride is quick and affordable from most parts of the metro area.</p>
        <p>If you are driving, Busch Stadium is located at the intersection of Interstate 64 and Interstate 70, with easy access from both highways. Multiple parking garages and surface lots surround the stadium within a short walk. Prices vary, but arriving early gives you the best selection and rates. The Kiener Plaza and Broadway garages are popular choices.</p>
        <p>Downtown St. Louis is highly walkable, and many fans staying at downtown hotels simply walk to the stadium. From the Gateway Arch grounds, the stadium is less than a ten-minute walk. The area around the park is well-lit and easy to navigate on foot, making the post-game walk back to your hotel or the MetroLink station straightforward and pleasant.</p>

          <p class="tip-box__label">Insider Tips</p>
          <p>Cardinals fans are some of the most welcoming in baseball. Do not be surprised if the family next to you strikes up a conversation, offers game-day recommendations, or shares stories about their favorite Cardinals memories. Visiting fans consistently say St. Louis is one of the friendliest parks they have attended.</p>
          <p>Toasted ravioli is the must-try local food at Busch Stadium. These breaded and deep-fried ravioli are a St. Louis original, served with marinara sauce at concession stands throughout the park. Pair them with a cold Bud from the brewery down the road. It is the authentic St. Louis game-day meal.</p>
          <p>Arrive early and spend time at the Stan Musial statue near the third-base entrance. The area fills up before first pitch with fans posing for photos and paying respects to the greatest Cardinal of all time. It is a great spot to soak in the pre-game atmosphere and appreciate the history of this franchise.</p>

      <!-- Honest Drawbacks -->

        <h2 id="honest-drawbacks">Honest Drawbacks</h2>
        <div class="drawback-box">
          <p class="drawback-box__label">Worth Knowing</p>
          <p>Summer humidity in St. Louis is brutal. July and August games can be sweltering, with heat indices well above 100 degrees. The open bowl design of Busch Stadium offers little shade in most seating sections. Bring sunscreen, stay hydrated, and consider evening games if you are sensitive to heat. This is the Midwest in summer, and it does not hold back.</p>
          <p>Ballpark Village, while convenient and entertaining, can feel corporate and commercialized. It is a polished entertainment district rather than an organic neighborhood scene. If you are looking for a more authentic St. Louis experience before the game, consider heading to The Hill for Italian food or Soulard for neighborhood bars instead.</p>
          <p>Upper deck seats at Busch Stadium are a long way from the action. The stadium holds nearly 45,500 fans, and the highest rows in the upper deck can feel disconnected from the game on the field. If budget allows, aim for seats in the lower bowl or the terrace level for a much more intimate experience.</p>
