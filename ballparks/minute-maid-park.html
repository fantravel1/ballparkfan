        <!-- What Makes Minute Maid Park Special -->
        <div class="content-block">
          <h2>What Makes Minute Maid Park Special</h2>
          <p>Minute Maid Park manages to do something that very few modern ballparks pull off — it feels both cutting-edge and deeply rooted in history at the same time. The retractable roof is the most obvious engineering feat, a massive structure that can open or close in about 12 minutes, shielding fans from Houston's brutal summer heat and humidity while still allowing the park to become an open-air stadium on those rare mild Texas evenings. When the roof is open, natural light floods the field and the whole atmosphere shifts. It is a park that can adapt to the weather, and in a city where summer temperatures regularly push past 95 degrees with suffocating humidity, that is not a luxury — it is a necessity.</p>

          <h3>Union Station Entrance</h3>
          <p>The main entrance to the ballpark is through the restored facade of Union Station, a historic 1911 railroad terminal that was preserved and incorporated into the stadium's design when the park was built. Walking through those grand arched doorways, you pass from the modern concrete of downtown Houston into a beautifully maintained piece of early twentieth-century architecture. The station's original interior details — the tile floors, the soaring ceilings, the old ticket windows — have been lovingly restored and now serve as the backdrop for the Astros' team store and gathering spaces. It is one of the most striking entrances in all of baseball, and it immediately tells you that this park cares about the city's history.</p>

          <h3>The Home Run Train</h3>
          <p>Above the left field wall sits an 800-foot stretch of railroad track, and on it rests a full-sized locomotive and coal tender. Every time an Astros player launches a home run, the train chugs along the tracks with its whistle blowing, lights flashing, and smoke billowing. It is loud, theatrical, and completely unique to Minute Maid Park. The train is a tribute to Houston's railroad heritage and the Union Station connection, and it has become one of the most iconic home run celebrations in the sport. Opposing fans may grumble about the noise, but there is no denying the spectacle.</p>

          <h3>The Crawford Boxes</h3>
          <p>The Crawford Boxes are the short left field seats that sit just 315 feet from home plate, creating one of the coziest home run porches in Major League Baseball. Named after Crawford Street, which runs alongside the park, these seats put fans dangerously close to the action. Left-handed pull hitters feast on this short porch, and sitting in the Crawford Boxes means you always have a chance of catching a ball. The proximity to the field, the angle looking back toward the plate, and the electric energy when a ball heads your way make these some of the most desirable seats in the house.</p>

          <h3>World Series Home</h3>
          <p>Minute Maid Park has been the stage for some of the most dramatic moments in recent baseball history. The Astros won their first World Series championship in 2017 and added a second title in 2022, both celebrated on this field. The park has hosted some legendary postseason games, including extra-inning thrillers and series-clinching moments that will live in the memories of Houston fans forever. That championship history gives the park a weight and significance that goes beyond its architecture — this is a place where history has been made.</p>

        <div class="content-block">
          <h2>Local Travel &amp; Nearby Attractions</h2>
          <p>Houston is the fourth-largest city in the United States, with a sprawling metropolitan area and a food scene that rivals any city in the country. Here are the top destinations to pair with your game day.</p>

          <div class="travel-card">
            <h3 class="travel-card__title">Downtown Houston Tunnel System</h3>
            <p class="travel-card__distance">Beneath the park &middot; Underground</p>
            <p class="travel-card__desc">One of Houston's best-kept secrets lies directly beneath the city streets. Seven miles of underground, climate-controlled tunnels connect more than 95 downtown buildings, filled with shops, restaurants, food courts, and services. The tunnel system was built to let Houstonians escape the oppressive surface heat, and it functions like a subterranean city. Entrances are marked in many downtown building lobbies. The tunnels are primarily open on weekdays during business hours.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="travel-card">
            <h3 class="travel-card__title">Space Center Houston</h3>
            <p class="travel-card__distance">25 miles &middot; Science &amp; Space</p>
            <p class="travel-card__desc">The official visitor center of NASA's Johnson Space Center is an absolute must-visit. Walk through real space shuttles, see the original Mission Control room where Apollo 11 was guided to the moon, touch an actual moon rock, and explore astronaut training facilities. The tram tour takes you behind the scenes at the working NASA campus. Allow at least half a day — there is an enormous amount to see, and it is genuinely world-class.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="travel-card">
            <h3 class="travel-card__title">Museum District</h3>
            <p class="travel-card__distance">3 miles &middot; Art &amp; Culture</p>
            <p class="travel-card__desc">Houston's Museum District packs 19 museums into a compact, walkable area, making it one of the densest cultural zones in the country. Highlights include the Houston Museum of Natural Science, the Museum of Fine Arts Houston (MFAH), the Menil Collection, and the Contemporary Arts Museum. Many of the museums offer free admission on Thursdays, making it a perfect daytime destination before an evening game.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="travel-card">
            <h3 class="travel-card__title">Buffalo Bayou Park</h3>
            <p class="travel-card__distance">1.5 miles &middot; Park &amp; Outdoors</p>
            <p class="travel-card__desc">A stunning 160-acre urban green space that stretches along the banks of Buffalo Bayou. The park features wide walking and bike trails, kayak and stand-up paddleboard rentals, public art installations, a dog park, and beautifully landscaped gardens. At dusk, head to the Waugh Drive Bridge to witness one of Houston's most unique natural spectacles — a colony of 250,000 Mexican free-tailed bats emerging from beneath the bridge.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="travel-card">
            <h3 class="travel-card__title">Historic Market Square</h3>
            <p class="travel-card__distance">1 mile &middot; Food &amp; Culture</p>
            <p class="travel-card__desc">Houston's oldest commercial area, dating back to the 1800s, is a vibrant hub of Tex-Mex restaurants, colorful shops, and live mariachi music. The surrounding blocks are packed with authentic Mexican and Central American food, from street tacos to full sit-down restaurants. On weekends, the area comes alive with outdoor markets and performances. It is a genuine slice of Houston's deep Latin American cultural roots.</p>

        <!-- Getting There -->
        <div class="content-block">
          <h2>Getting There</h2>
          <h3>METRORail</h3>
          <p>The easiest way to reach Minute Maid Park without a car is the METRORail Red Line. Take it to the Convention District station, which puts you within a short walk of the ballpark's main gates. The Red Line connects to several park-and-ride lots and runs through the heart of downtown Houston. On game days, trains run frequently and are a popular option for fans staying in the downtown core.</p>
          <h3>Driving</h3>
          <p>Minute Maid Park sits at the intersection of three major highways: I-10, I-45, and US-59. If you are driving, you will have no trouble finding the park — it is visible from the highway and well-signed. Multiple parking garages surround the stadium, including the official Astros lots and numerous privately operated structures. Expect to pay anywhere from $20 to $50 depending on proximity and the opponent. Pre-booking a parking spot through an app is recommended for weekend and postseason games.</p>
          <h3>Downtown Hotels</h3>
          <p>If you are staying in downtown Houston, Minute Maid Park is an easy walk from most major hotels. The park is centrally located in the eastern edge of downtown, and the walk from the hotel clusters along Main Street or the Theater District takes 10 to 20 minutes on flat, well-lit sidewalks. The downtown location is one of the park's biggest logistical advantages.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Fan Tips -->
        <div class="content-block">
          <h2>Fan Tips</h2>
          <div class="tip-box">
            <p class="tip-box__label">Insider Tips</p>
            <p>If you want a chance to catch a home run ball, the Crawford Boxes in left field are your best bet. These seats sit just 315 feet from home plate, making them the shortest porch in the park. They are popular and sell quickly, so buy early. The energy in this section during a close game is electric.</p>
            <p>Do not leave without trying the brisket from Killen's BBQ, one of the most acclaimed barbecue operations in Texas. Pitmaster Ronnie Killen runs a stand inside the park that serves legitimately excellent smoked brisket — this is not typical ballpark food. The brisket sandwich, the loaded brisket nachos, and the sausage links are all outstanding.</p>
            <p>If the roof is open, you are in for a treat. An open-roof game at Minute Maid Park is a noticeably different and special experience compared to a closed-roof game. The natural light, the breeze, and the view of the Houston skyline above the outfield walls elevate everything. Check the Astros' social media accounts on game day — they usually announce the roof decision a few hours before first pitch.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <!-- Honest Drawbacks -->
        <div class="content-block">
          <h2>Honest Drawbacks</h2>
          <div class="drawback-box">
            <p class="drawback-box__label">Worth Knowing</p>
            <p>Houston's heat and humidity are legendary, and even with the retractable roof and air conditioning, you will feel it. Walking to the park from a parking garage or hotel in July or August means battling temperatures that regularly exceed 95 degrees with humidity that makes the air feel like a warm, wet blanket. The interior of the park is climate-controlled when the roof is closed, but the concourse areas near the open ends can still feel warm. Dress light, drink water, and do not underestimate the Texas summer.</p>
            <p>The area immediately surrounding Minute Maid Park is dominated by parking lots and highway infrastructure. Unlike ballparks nestled in vibrant walkable neighborhoods, the blocks around the stadium are mostly asphalt and concrete. There is no lively strip of bars and restaurants steps from the gates the way you find at parks in San Diego or Chicago. Downtown Houston has good dining options, but they require a short walk or rideshare — the immediate vicinity is utilitarian.</p>
            <p>Houston is a car-dependent city. Public transit exists, and the METRORail Red Line works well for getting to the game, but getting around the broader Houston area without a car is difficult. If you are planning a multi-day trip and want to visit Space Center Houston, the Museum District, or any of the city's incredible restaurant neighborhoods, you will almost certainly need a rental car or plan on frequent rideshare use.</p>
