        <!-- What Makes Camden Yards Special -->
        <div class="content-block">
          <h2>What Makes Camden Yards Special</h2>
          <p>Oriole Park at Camden Yards is not just a ballpark — it is the ballpark that launched a revolution. When it opened on April 6, 1992, it shattered the mold of the cookie-cutter multipurpose stadiums that had dominated American sports for three decades. Camden Yards proved that a modern stadium could honor the intimate, asymmetric charm of baseball's golden-age parks while delivering every contemporary comfort. Every retro-style ballpark built since — from PNC Park to Oracle Park — owes its existence to this one.</p>
          <p>The defining visual is the B&O Warehouse, an eight-story, 1,016-foot-long brick warehouse originally built in 1898 for the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. At the time of the park's opening, it was the longest building on the East Coast. Rather than tear it down, architect HOK Sport (now Populous) made it the centerpiece, anchoring the view beyond right field with a wall of weathered red brick that gives Camden Yards a sense of permanence no new-build can fake.</p>
          <p>Between the warehouse and the right-field seats runs the Eutaw Street promenade, a public walkway lined with food vendors, souvenir shops, and bronze plaques embedded in the ground marking where the longest home runs have landed. Walking Eutaw Street on a game day is one of the great sensory experiences in baseball — the smell of pit smoke from Boog's BBQ mixing with the roar of the crowd every time a fly ball drifts toward the warehouse.</p>
          <p>The park sits in the heart of downtown Baltimore, tucked among brick row houses, old rail yards, and the Inner Harbor waterfront. It feels like it has been there for a century. That intimate, woven-into-the-city quality is exactly what every ballpark since has tried to copy — and what makes Camden Yards the original and still one of the best.</p>
          <p>Adding to the neighborhood's deep baseball roots, the birthplace of Babe Ruth sits just two blocks away on Emory Street, now preserved as the Babe Ruth Birthplace and Museum. From the Sultan of Swat to the Warehouse, Camden Yards is layered in history you can walk through and touch.</p>

        <div class="content-block">
          <h2>Local Travel &amp; Nearby Attractions</h2>
          <p>Baltimore is a city of distinctive neighborhoods, world-class seafood, and a waterfront that rewards exploration. Here are the highlights within easy reach of Camden Yards.</p>

          <div class="travel-card">
            <h3 class="travel-card__title">Inner Harbor</h3>
            <p class="travel-card__distance">0.5 miles from Camden Yards</p>
            <p class="travel-card__desc">Baltimore's signature waterfront destination. Home to the National Aquarium, the Maryland Science Center, and a wide promenade lined with restaurants and shops. Perfect for a pre-game walk or a full day of exploring. The waterfront dining options — especially the crab houses — are a Baltimore rite of passage.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="travel-card">
            <h3 class="travel-card__title">Fort McHenry</h3>
            <p class="travel-card__distance">3 miles from Camden Yards</p>
            <p class="travel-card__desc">The birthplace of the Star-Spangled Banner. This star-shaped fort defended Baltimore Harbor during the War of 1812, and its bombardment inspired Francis Scott Key to write the national anthem. The fort offers sweeping harbor views and a stirring sense of American history that pairs well with a day at the ballpark.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="travel-card">
            <h3 class="travel-card__title">Babe Ruth Birthplace Museum</h3>
            <p class="travel-card__distance">2 blocks from Camden Yards</p>
            <p class="travel-card__desc">The actual row house at 216 Emory Street where George Herman "Babe" Ruth was born in 1895, now a museum dedicated to the Sultan of Swat. Packed with baseball memorabilia, personal artifacts, and Orioles history. You can practically see the ballpark from the front steps.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="travel-card">
            <h3 class="travel-card__title">Fells Point</h3>
            <p class="travel-card__distance">1.5 miles from Camden Yards</p>
            <p class="travel-card__desc">A historic waterfront neighborhood with cobblestone streets, 18th-century architecture, and Baltimore's best concentration of bars and restaurants. Post-game, Fells Point is where locals and visitors converge for craft beer, raw bars, and live music along the harbor.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="travel-card">
            <h3 class="travel-card__title">B&amp;O Railroad Museum</h3>
            <p class="travel-card__distance">0.5 miles from Camden Yards</p>
            <p class="travel-card__desc">The birthplace of American railroading. Housed in a stunning 1884 roundhouse, the museum features historic locomotives, railcars, and the story of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad that gave Camden Yards its iconic warehouse. A fitting companion to a ballpark steeped in railroad heritage.</p>

        <!-- Getting There -->
        <div class="content-block">
          <h2>Getting There</h2>
          <h3>Light Rail</h3>
          <p>The MTA Light Rail has a dedicated Camden Yards station directly adjacent to the ballpark. The Light Rail line connects to BWI Airport, Hunt Valley, and downtown Baltimore, making it the easiest and most stress-free way to reach the park. Trains run frequently on game days.</p>
          <h3>MARC Train</h3>
          <p>The MARC Camden Line stops at Camden Station, right next to the ballpark's main entrance. The Camden Line connects Camden Yards to Washington, D.C.'s Union Station, making day trips from the capital straightforward and affordable. Service is limited to weekdays, so check schedules for weekend games.</p>
          <h3>Driving</h3>
          <p>Camden Yards is accessible via I-95 (exit 53) and I-83 (exit to downtown). The park sits at the intersection of Baltimore's major highway corridors, making it easy to reach from all directions. Follow signs to "Stadium Area" once you are close.</p>
          <h3>Parking</h3>
          <p>Several parking garages and surface lots surround the ballpark, with the largest being the lots along Russell Street. Expect to pay between $10 and $30 depending on proximity. Arriving early secures closer spots and lets you enjoy Eutaw Street before first pitch. Street parking in surrounding neighborhoods is limited on game days.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Fan Tips -->
        <div class="content-block">
          <h2>Fan Tips</h2>
          <div class="tip-box">
            <p class="tip-box__label">Insider Tips</p>
            <p>Walk Eutaw Street before the game and look down — bronze plaques mark exactly where the longest home runs have landed over the years. It is one of the best free experiences in baseball.</p>
            <p>Boog's BBQ, run by former Orioles slugger Boog Powell, is legendary for good reason. The pit beef sandwich is a Baltimore institution. Get there early because the line gets long after first pitch.</p>
            <p>For the best views of the B&O Warehouse, sit in the upper deck behind home plate. The warehouse fills the entire right-field backdrop, and on a clear evening the red brick glows in the late-afternoon sun. It is one of the most photogenic views in all of baseball.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <!-- Honest Drawbacks -->
        <div class="content-block">
          <h2>Honest Drawbacks</h2>
          <div class="drawback-box">
            <p class="drawback-box__label">Worth Knowing</p>
            <p>Upper-deck seats, especially in the outfield corners, can feel far from the action. The park's open design means the upper levels lack the cozy enclosure of smaller parks. If sightlines matter to you, spring for lower-level seats.</p>
            <p>The area immediately surrounding Camden Yards is still developing. Beyond the Inner Harbor corridor, some blocks can feel quiet or underdeveloped on non-game days. Stick to well-traveled routes if you are walking to Fells Point or Federal Hill after dark.</p>
            <p>Baltimore summers are humid. July and August night games can be sticky and uncomfortable, especially in the upper deck where there is little shade. Bring water, wear light clothing, and embrace the sweat — it is part of the East Coast baseball experience.</p>
