        <!-- What Makes Citizens Bank Park Special -->
        <div class="content-block">
          <h2>What Makes Citizens Bank Park Special</h2>
          <p>Citizens Bank Park is defined by the people who fill it. Philadelphia Phillies fans are, by virtually every measure, the most intense fanbase in baseball. They are loud, unrelenting, deeply knowledgeable about the game, and absolutely merciless to both opposing teams and their own players when the effort falls short. This is the city that booed Mike Schmidt and threw snowballs at Santa Claus. That reputation is not a caricature — it is a point of pride. When 42,000 Philly fans lock into a big moment, Citizens Bank Park generates an atmosphere that no other regular-season ballpark in the sport can match. The 2022 postseason run turned the park into a cauldron that rattled visiting teams and reminded the rest of baseball what a truly engaged crowd sounds like.</p>
          <p>Beyond the fans, the park delivers one of the best food experiences in Major League Baseball. Ashburn Alley, the wide concourse running behind center field, is less a concession area and more a legitimate food court that happens to overlook a baseball diamond. Named after Phillies Hall of Famer Richie Ashburn, the alley is packed with local Philadelphia restaurants and specialty vendors that go far beyond the standard hot-dog-and-beer formula. It is one of the few ballpark food destinations worth arriving early for on its own merits.</p>
          <p>In left-center field, a massive Liberty Bell replica towers over the outfield fence. When a Phillie hits a home run, the bell lights up neon red and swings back and forth while the crowd erupts — a signature visual moment that connects the park to the city's revolutionary history. It is cheesy in the best possible way, and it never gets old.</p>
          <p>Then there is the Phillie Phanatic, widely considered the greatest mascot in professional sports. The big green furry creature on an ATV has been terrorizing opposing players, dancing on dugout roofs, and delighting crowds since 1978. The Phanatic is not some sideshow between innings — he is a genuine part of the game-day experience, and his antics with visiting players and umpires are consistently entertaining even for fans who have seen the act a hundred times.</p>
          <p>The park itself features open concourses that allow fans to watch the game from almost anywhere while they walk and eat. The upper-deck views offer glimpses of the Philadelphia skyline beyond the outfield, connecting the ballpark to the city in a way that enclosed stadiums cannot. Citizens Bank Park is not the prettiest park in baseball and it does not try to be — it is built for baseball, for food, and for a fanbase that takes both very seriously.</p>

        <div class="content-block">
          <h2>Local Travel &amp; Nearby Attractions</h2>
          <p>Philadelphia is one of the great American cities — a place where the nation was founded, where the cheesesteak was invented, and where the art and food scenes rival any city on the East Coast. Here are the must-visit spots near Citizens Bank Park.</p>

          <div class="travel-card">
            <h3 class="travel-card__title">Independence Hall &amp; Liberty Bell</h3>
            <p class="travel-card__distance">6 miles from Citizens Bank Park &middot; Historic</p>
            <p class="travel-card__desc">The birthplace of American democracy. Independence Hall is where the Declaration of Independence was debated and signed in 1776 and where the United States Constitution was drafted in 1787. The Liberty Bell, with its famous crack, sits in its own pavilion across the street. Both are free to visit, though timed tickets are required for Independence Hall during peak season. This is essential American history that every visitor to Philadelphia should experience.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="travel-card">
            <h3 class="travel-card__title">Pat's vs Geno's Cheesesteaks</h3>
            <p class="travel-card__distance">5 miles from Citizens Bank Park &middot; Food</p>
            <p class="travel-card__desc">Philadelphia's most famous rival cheesesteak stands sit directly across the street from each other at the intersection of 9th Street and Passyunk Avenue in South Philly. Pat's King of Steaks claims to have invented the cheesesteak in 1930; Geno's Steaks opened across the way in 1966. Both are open 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The rivalry is fierce, the opinions are strong, and the only way to settle it is to try both. Order "whiz wit" — Cheez Whiz with fried onions — for the classic Philadelphia experience.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="travel-card">
            <h3 class="travel-card__title">Philadelphia Museum of Art &amp; Rocky Steps</h3>
            <p class="travel-card__distance">7 miles from Citizens Bank Park &middot; Art &amp; Culture</p>
            <p class="travel-card__desc">One of the largest and most important art museums in the United States, with a collection spanning 2,000 years of creative achievement. But most visitors know it for one thing first: the 72 stone steps out front that Sylvester Stallone sprinted up in Rocky. Running the steps and posing at the bronze Rocky statue at the bottom is a Philadelphia rite of passage. The Rodin Museum, housing the largest collection of Auguste Rodin's work outside Paris, sits just a short walk up the Benjamin Franklin Parkway.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="travel-card">
            <h3 class="travel-card__title">Reading Terminal Market</h3>
            <p class="travel-card__distance">6 miles from Citizens Bank Park &middot; Food &amp; Market</p>
            <p class="travel-card__desc">A historic enclosed public market that has operated continuously since 1893, located beneath the former Reading Railroad terminal at 12th and Arch Streets. The market houses over 80 vendors selling everything from Amish baked goods and handmade pretzels to fresh produce and prepared food. DiNic's roast pork sandwich — slow-roasted pork with sharp provolone and broccoli rabe — has been called the best sandwich in America. Arrive hungry and plan to stay a while.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="travel-card">
            <h3 class="travel-card__title">South Philadelphia Sports Complex</h3>
            <p class="travel-card__distance">Adjacent to Citizens Bank Park &middot; Sports &amp; Entertainment</p>
            <p class="travel-card__desc">Citizens Bank Park sits within a massive sports complex that is home to all of Philadelphia's major professional teams. Lincoln Financial Field, home of the NFL's Eagles, is right next door. The Wells Fargo Center, where the 76ers and Flyers play, is a short walk away. Xfinity Live!, an entertainment and dining complex connecting the venues, offers bars, restaurants, and live music before and after games. On a day when multiple Philadelphia teams are playing, the Sports Complex becomes one of the most energetic gathering spots in American sports.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <!-- Getting There -->
        <div class="content-block">
          <h2>Getting There</h2>
          <h3>SEPTA Broad Street Line</h3>
          <p>The easiest and most reliable way to reach Citizens Bank Park is the SEPTA Broad Street Line, Philadelphia's north-south subway. Take the Broad Street Line southbound to NRG Station (formerly AT&T Station), which sits directly within the South Philadelphia Sports Complex. The walk from the platform to the ballpark gates takes about five minutes. The ride from Center City takes roughly 15 minutes, and trains run frequently on game days with extended service after night games. The Broad Street Line connects to other SEPTA regional rail and subway lines at City Hall station.</p>
          <h3>Driving &amp; I-95</h3>
          <p>Citizens Bank Park is easily accessible by car via Interstate 95. From I-95, take the Broad Street exit and follow signs to the Sports Complex. The park sits at the southern end of Broad Street, Philadelphia's main north-south artery. From the Pennsylvania Turnpike or New Jersey, follow signs for I-76 West to I-95 South. The Sports Complex is well-signed from all major highways.</p>
          <h3>Parking</h3>
          <p>The South Philadelphia Sports Complex offers extensive parking in large surface lots surrounding the stadiums. Lots open several hours before game time. Parking typically costs between $15 and $25, and pre-purchasing a parking pass online can save time at the gate. The lots are large and flat, making them popular for tailgating before Phillies games — arrive early if you want to set up a proper tailgate spread.</p>
          <h3>AT&amp;T Station</h3>
          <p>AT&T Station, now officially NRG Station, is the dedicated SEPTA subway stop for the Sports Complex. It serves both the Broad Street Line express and local trains. On game days, SEPTA adds extra trains and keeps the station staffed to handle the postgame surge. It is the single best way to avoid the parking lot traffic that can add 30 to 45 minutes to your drive home after a sold-out game.</p>

        <!-- Fan Tips -->
        <div class="content-block">
          <h2>Fan Tips</h2>
          <div class="tip-box">
            <p class="tip-box__label">A Word of Warning</p>
            <p>Do not wear opposing team gear to Citizens Bank Park. This is not a joke and it is not an exaggeration. Philadelphia fans are the most vocally hostile crowd in baseball toward visiting fans, and wearing the wrong jersey will guarantee a full game of loud, creative, and relentless heckling. If you are a visiting fan, wear neutral colors and you will have a perfectly fine time. If you insist on repping your team, have thick skin and a sense of humor — you will need both.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="tip-box">
            <p class="tip-box__label">Tony Luke's Cheesesteaks</p>
            <p>You do not need to leave the park for an excellent cheesesteak. Tony Luke's, one of Philadelphia's most respected cheesesteak shops, operates a stand inside Citizens Bank Park. The cheesesteak is legit — thinly sliced beef, melted cheese, and a proper Amoroso roll. It is one of the best food items in any MLB ballpark and a must-try for first-time visitors.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="tip-box">
            <p class="tip-box__label">Ashburn Alley Is the Move</p>
            <p>Ashburn Alley, the wide concourse behind center field, is the best food area in the entire park and one of the best in all of baseball. This is where you will find the highest concentration of local vendors, specialty items, and craft beer options. Plan to spend at least 30 minutes exploring Ashburn Alley before the game. It gets crowded after first pitch, so arrive early to eat without fighting the lines.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="tip-box">
            <p class="tip-box__label">Crab Fries from Chickie's &amp; Pete's</p>
            <p>Chickie's and Pete's crab fries are a Philadelphia stadium institution. These are crinkle-cut fries dusted with a savory Old Bay-style crab seasoning and served with a warm white cheese sauce for dipping. They are available at multiple locations throughout Citizens Bank Park and are the single most popular concession item in the building. Get them at least once — they are addictive and unlike anything you will find at other ballparks.</p>
          </div>

        <!-- Honest Drawbacks -->
        <div class="content-block">
          <h2>Honest Drawbacks</h2>
          <div class="drawback-box">
            <p class="drawback-box__label">Hostile to Visitors</p>
            <p>Philadelphia fans can be genuinely hostile to visiting fans, and that reputation is earned. The heckling goes beyond playful banter — it can be aggressive, profane, and relentless, especially in the upper deck and outfield sections during heated games or rivalry matchups. Most interactions stay verbal, but the intensity can be uncomfortable for families with young children or fans who prefer a more laid-back atmosphere. This is the tradeoff for the most passionate crowd in baseball: the energy is extraordinary when it is directed at the opposing team, but it can be a lot to handle when it is directed at you.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="drawback-box">
            <p class="drawback-box__label">Bland Surroundings</p>
            <p>The South Philadelphia Sports Complex is exactly what it sounds like — a cluster of stadiums and parking lots in an industrial-feeling part of South Philly. There is no charming neighborhood to walk through before or after the game, no tree-lined streets, and no local bars within easy walking distance outside of Xfinity Live!. The complex is designed for driving in, watching the game, and driving out. If you want the full Philadelphia experience, plan to spend time in Center City, South Street, or Passyunk Avenue before heading to the park.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="drawback-box">
            <p class="drawback-box__label">Wind and Cold</p>
            <p>Citizens Bank Park's open design means wind swirls through the stadium in unpredictable patterns, especially in April, May, September, and October. Night games in the shoulder months can be surprisingly cold, even when the daytime temperature felt comfortable. The wind chill in the upper deck can drop the effective temperature ten degrees or more below the posted forecast. Bring layers, especially for early-season and late-season games. The postseason weather in Philadelphia is genuinely cold, and the open concourses offer little shelter from the wind.</p>
