        <!-- What Makes Citi Field Special -->
        <div class="content-block">
          <h2>What Makes Citi Field Special</h2>
          <p>Citi Field is a ballpark built on memory and meaning. It opened in 2009 to replace Shea Stadium, and the Mets used the opportunity to connect their franchise to something deeper than their own relatively short history. The result is a park that honors Brooklyn, celebrates Queens, and gives one of baseball's most passionate fan bases a home that finally feels worthy of the devotion.</p>

          <h3>The Jackie Robinson Rotunda</h3>
          <p>The grand entrance of Citi Field is not named for a Met. It is named for Jackie Robinson, the man who broke baseball's color barrier with the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1947. The rotunda is a soaring, multi-story atrium behind home plate, lined with Robinson's own words about courage, citizenship, and persistence. A massive number 42 hangs overhead. The Mets trace their lineage to Brooklyn through the Dodgers' departure, and this tribute is their way of honoring that history. It is one of the most powerful entrances in all of professional sports, and it sets the tone for everything that follows.</p>

          <h3>The Home Run Apple</h3>
          <p>When a Mets player hits a home run, a giant red apple rises from a top hat beyond the center-field fence. The tradition dates back to Shea Stadium, where the original apple became one of baseball's most beloved quirks. The current version at Citi Field is larger and more elaborate, but the effect is the same: pure, unfiltered joy. It is silly and wonderful and completely Mets.</p>

          <h3>Ebbets Field-Inspired Brick Facade</h3>
          <p>The exterior of Citi Field is modeled after Ebbets Field, the legendary Brooklyn home of the Dodgers that was demolished in 1960. The red brick facade, arched windows, and classic proportions are a deliberate callback to a ballpark most living fans never saw but many still mourn. It gives Citi Field an architectural warmth and a sense of history that most modern stadiums lack entirely.</p>

          <h3>Shake Shack &amp; Queens Food Diversity</h3>
          <p>Citi Field is widely considered one of the best food parks in baseball, and the reason is simple: it sits in Queens, the most ethnically diverse urban area on the planet. The concessions reflect that. Shake Shack operates a full location inside the park and draws lines that rival the ones at Madison Square Park. But the real story is the broader food program, which rotates through vendors representing the global cuisines of the borough — Latin American, Asian, Middle Eastern, and everything in between. You can eat your way around the world without leaving your seat level.</p>

          <h3>The Tom Seaver Statue</h3>
          <p>Tom Seaver is the greatest Met who ever lived, and his statue outside Citi Field captures the high-kicking delivery that earned him the nickname "Tom Terrific." The address of the stadium itself — 41 Seaver Way — was renamed in his honor. Seaver won three Cy Young Awards, pitched the Mets to their miraculous 1969 World Series title, and remains the emotional touchstone of the entire franchise. Pause here before you go inside.</p>

        <div class="content-block">
          <h2>Local Travel &amp; Nearby Attractions</h2>
          <p>Citi Field sits in Flushing, Queens — one of the most vibrant, culturally rich neighborhoods in New York City. Most visitors go straight to the stadium and miss everything around it. Do not make that mistake.</p>

          <div class="travel-card">
            <h3 class="travel-card__title">Flushing Chinatown &amp; Main Street</h3>
            <p class="travel-card__distance">0.5 miles from Citi Field</p>
            <p class="travel-card__desc">Flushing is home to the largest Chinatown in New York City, surpassing Manhattan's in both size and culinary quality. Main Street and the surrounding blocks are packed with incredible dumplings, hand-pulled noodles, dim sum parlors, Sichuan hot pot, and Taiwanese street food. This is not a tourist version of Chinese food — it is the real thing, served in the language it was created in. Arrive two hours before the game and eat here instead of inside the park. You will not regret it.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="travel-card">
            <h3 class="travel-card__title">USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center</h3>
            <p class="travel-card__distance">Adjacent to Citi Field</p>
            <p class="travel-card__desc">The home of the US Open is literally next door. Arthur Ashe Stadium, the largest tennis venue in the world, is visible from inside Citi Field. During late August and early September, you can catch a Mets game and the US Open on the same day — one of the great doubleheaders in New York sports. Outside of tournament season, the grounds are open and worth a walk.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="travel-card">
            <h3 class="travel-card__title">Queens Night Market</h3>
            <p class="travel-card__distance">Seasonal, nearby — Saturday nights</p>
            <p class="travel-card__desc">The Queens Night Market is a seasonal open-air food market celebrating the borough's staggering diversity, with vendors representing over 80 countries. Held on Saturday nights in nearby Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, it is one of the most authentic international food experiences in the United States. Arepas, takoyaki, Tibetan momos, Trinidadian doubles — all for a few dollars each. If you are visiting on a Saturday, build your evening around this.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="travel-card">
            <h3 class="travel-card__title">Flushing Meadows-Corona Park</h3>
            <p class="travel-card__distance">Surrounding Citi Field</p>
            <p class="travel-card__desc">Citi Field sits within Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, the site of both the 1939 and 1964 World's Fairs. The Unisphere — a 140-foot stainless steel globe — is the park's iconic centerpiece and one of the most photographed landmarks in Queens. The Queens Museum houses a panoramic scale model of all five boroughs, and there is a boating lake, walking paths, and green space stretching in every direction. Arrive early and explore.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="travel-card">
            <h3 class="travel-card__title">Manhattan via 7 Train</h3>
            <p class="travel-card__distance">30 minutes from Citi Field</p>
            <p class="travel-card__desc">The 7 train connects Citi Field directly to the heart of Manhattan. You can be in Times Square or Grand Central Terminal in about 30 minutes, with access to all of New York City from there. The 7 line also passes through some of the best food neighborhoods in Queens — Jackson Heights for Indian and South American, Woodside for Filipino and Thai, Sunnyside for Turkish and Romanian. The subway ride itself is a culinary tour.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <!-- Getting There -->
        <div class="content-block">
          <h2>Getting There</h2>

          <h3>7 Train to Mets-Willets Point (Recommended)</h3>
          <p>The <strong>7 train</strong> is the definitive way to reach Citi Field. Take it to the <strong>Mets-Willets Point</strong> station, which drops you off steps from the ballpark entrance. From Times Square or Grand Central Terminal in Manhattan, the ride takes roughly 30 minutes. On game days, the MTA runs additional 7 train service. The ride itself is part of the experience — the train rises above ground in Queens and you can see the stadium and the Unisphere as you approach.</p>

          <h3>Long Island Rail Road (LIRR)</h3>
          <p>The LIRR operates service to <strong>Mets-Willets Point</strong> station from Penn Station in Manhattan and various Long Island stops. The ride from Penn Station takes about 15-20 minutes and is less crowded than the 7 train, though slightly more expensive. This is a good option for fans coming from Long Island or anyone who wants a faster, more comfortable ride.</p>

          <h3>Driving &amp; Parking</h3>
          <p>Citi Field is surrounded by large parking lots with ample capacity. Parking is available in lots adjacent to the stadium, with prices typically ranging from $25-45 on game days. Access is via the Grand Central Parkway, the Van Wyck Expressway, or the Whitestone Expressway. Traffic backs up considerably before and after games on all approaches. The subway is strongly recommended.</p>

          <h3>Buses</h3>
          <p>Several MTA bus routes serve the Citi Field area, including the <strong>Q48</strong> and <strong>Q25</strong> lines. Buses are a reasonable option if you are already in Queens but slower than the 7 train from Manhattan. Express bus service from other boroughs is also available on game days — check the MTA website for schedules.</p>

        <!-- Fan Tips -->
        <div class="content-block">
          <h2>Fan Tips</h2>
          <div class="tip-box">
            <p class="tip-box__label">Insider Tips</p>
            <p>The Shake Shack line inside Citi Field is notoriously long — sometimes 30 to 45 minutes. If Shake Shack is a priority, head there immediately when gates open rather than waiting until game time. Alternatively, eat at the original Shake Shack in Manhattan before you take the 7 train.</p>
            <p>Walk through the Jackie Robinson Rotunda even if your seats are on the other side of the stadium. It is the architectural and emotional heart of the ballpark, and rushing past it to find your section means missing the single best feature of Citi Field.</p>
            <p>The Coca-Cola Corner in right field offers some of the best value seats in the park. You are close to the field, the sightlines are good, and the tickets are significantly cheaper than seats behind home plate. For a first visit on a budget, this is the spot.</p>
            <p>Do not sleep on the Queens food vendors inside the park. The rotating concession program highlights local restaurants from across the borough, and many of them are genuinely excellent — not just good "for a ballpark." Ask around, check the signs, and be adventurous.</p>

        <!-- Honest Drawbacks -->
        <div class="content-block">
          <h2>Honest Drawbacks</h2>
          <div class="drawback-box">
            <p class="drawback-box__label">What could be better</p>
            <p>Flushing can feel far from Manhattan, especially for visitors staying in Midtown or downtown. The 7 train ride is 30 minutes each way on a good day, and after a night game the return trip can feel long and crowded. If you are on a tight schedule, plan for the commute.</p>
            <p>The parking lots surrounding Citi Field are vast and soulless. Acres of asphalt stretch in every direction, with no trees, shade, or character. Tailgating helps, but the walk from your car to the gates on a hot July afternoon is not pleasant. This is one of the park's biggest aesthetic weaknesses.</p>
            <p>Citi Field does not carry the same iconic weight as Yankee Stadium across the river. Mets fans know this and mostly do not care — the franchise identity is built on lovable underdog energy, not dynastic prestige. But if you are visiting New York for one baseball game and want the "legendary" experience, many visitors default to the Bronx. That is their loss, but it is the reality.</p>
            <p>The main concourses can get crowded, particularly on the field level behind home plate. Navigating from one section to another during popular games means weaving through dense foot traffic, especially near the premium food vendors and the Shake Shack area. The upper deck concourse is more relaxed.</p>

              <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>The Jackie Robinson Rotunda is the grand main entrance of Citi Field, a soaring multi-story atrium dedicated to Jackie Robinson, who broke baseball's color barrier with the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1947. The rotunda features Robinson's own words inscribed on the walls, historical displays about his life and impact, and a prominent number 42 — his retired number, honored permanently across all of Major League Baseball. The Mets chose to honor Robinson because the franchise traces its spiritual lineage to the Brooklyn Dodgers. It is free to walk through with a game ticket and is one of the most meaningful spaces in any professional sports venue.</p>

              <summary>What food is Citi Field known for?</summary>
              <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>Citi Field is consistently ranked among the best ballparks in baseball for food. The most famous option is Shake Shack, which operates a full location inside the park — though the lines are long, so go early or right when gates open. Beyond Shake Shack, the park showcases the culinary diversity of Queens through a rotating roster of local food vendors. You will find everything from Latin American street food to Asian fusion to wood-fired pizza and craft beer. Many fans also eat before the game in nearby Flushing, which is home to the largest Chinatown in New York City and offers world-class dumplings, hand-pulled noodles, and dim sum within a half-mile walk of the stadium.</p>
