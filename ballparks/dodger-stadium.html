        <!-- What Makes Dodger Stadium Special -->
        <div class="content-block">
          <h2>What Makes Dodger Stadium Special</h2>
          <p>Dodger Stadium is the largest ballpark in Major League Baseball. With a seating capacity of 56,000, it dwarfs every other stadium in the league, and on a packed summer night the energy is unlike anything else in baseball. But the size alone is not what makes this place extraordinary — it is the setting.</p>
          <p>The stadium sits atop Chavez Ravine, a hilltop just north of downtown Los Angeles with sweeping views of the San Gabriel Mountains to the north and the downtown skyline to the south. Palm trees ring the parking lots and peek above the outfield walls, framing a landscape that is unmistakably Southern California. On a clear day, the entire San Gabriel range stretches across the horizon beyond center field like a painted backdrop.</p>
          <p>Then there are the sunsets. Dodger Stadium faces east, which means the golden-hour light pours in behind you from the west during evening games. The sky turns burnt orange and pink over the ridgelines, the stadium lights warm up, and for about 20 minutes the entire park glows. It is one of the most beautiful moments in all of sports, and it happens naturally, game after game, all summer long.</p>
          <p>The architecture is classic mid-century modern — clean lines, wavy roofline canopies, and a color palette of Dodger Blue and white that has barely changed since 1962. There are no corporate excesses here, no retro-nostalgia gimmicks. Dodger Stadium simply looks like what a ballpark is supposed to look like, and it has looked this way for more than sixty years.</p>
          <p>And then there is the legacy of Vin Scully. For 67 seasons, Scully was the voice of the Dodgers, and his storytelling made this stadium feel like a living room for millions of Angelenos. The avenue leading to the park was renamed Vin Scully Avenue in his honor. His presence is woven into the fabric of the place — in the press box, the address, and the way fans still carry transistor radios into the stands out of habit and tradition.</p>

          <h2>Local Travel &amp; Nearby Attractions</h2>
          <p>Dodger Stadium sits at the edge of several of LA's most vibrant neighborhoods. Arrive early, explore after the game, or build an entire day around your visit. These spots are all within a few miles of the park.</p>

            <p class="travel-card__desc">The birthplace of Los Angeles.

        <!-- Getting There -->
        <div class="content-block">
          <h2>Getting There</h2>
          <h3>Dodger Stadium Express</h3>
          <p>The Dodger Stadium Express shuttle runs from Union Station directly to the ballpark and is free with a valid game ticket. It is by far the best way to get to the game. Union Station is the hub for Metro Rail, Metrolink commuter trains, and Amtrak — so you can connect from almost anywhere in the LA region without driving. Shuttles run frequently starting 90 minutes before first pitch and continue for 45 minutes after the final out.</p>
          <h3>Driving &amp; Parking</h3>
          <p>If you drive, arrive early. The stadium sits on 300 acres with massive parking lots, but the access roads funnel through just a few entry points and traffic backs up quickly. Parking is available on-site — reserve in advance to save time and guarantee a spot. The lots are enormous, so note your location carefully. General parking fills from the farthest lots first; preferred and reserved lots are closer to the gates.</p>
          <h3>Rideshare</h3>
          <p>Rideshare pickup and dropoff zones are designated near the main entrance on Vin Scully Avenue. After the game, expect significant wait times due to traffic congestion. Many fans walk partway down the hill toward Sunset Boulevard or other pickup points to reduce wait times and avoid the worst of the parking lot gridlock.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Fan Tips -->
        <div class="content-block">
          <h2>Fan Tips</h2>
          <div class="tip-box">
            <p class="tip-box__label">Insider Tips</p>
            <p>Dodger Dogs are a must — get them grilled, not steamed, for the full experience. Reserve your parking online before game day to skip the chaos at the gates. The top deck on the third-base side offers the best sunset views in all of baseball, and the seats are the cheapest in the house. For atmosphere, head to the Left Field Pavilion — it is the loudest, rowdiest section in the stadium and where the most dedicated fans sit.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <!-- Honest Drawbacks -->
        <div class="content-block">
          <h2>Honest Drawbacks</h2>
          <div class="drawback-box">
            <p class="drawback-box__label">Worth Knowing</p>
            <p>Getting in and out of Dodger Stadium is a traffic nightmare — plan for it. There is no direct public transit to the park itself (the Express shuttle from Union Station is the closest thing). The parking lots are massive, which means a long walk from your car to the gates, especially in general parking. After the game, you will sit in the lot for 30 to 45 minutes unless you leave early or wait until the crowds thin out. This is the single biggest knock on an otherwise spectacular ballpark.</p>
