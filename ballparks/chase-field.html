        <!-- What Makes Chase Field Special -->
        <div class="content-block">
          <h2>What Makes Chase Field Special</h2>
          <p>Chase Field holds a singular distinction in Major League Baseball: it was the first stadium ever built with both a retractable roof and air conditioning. When it opened in 1998 as Bank One Ballpark, this was not a luxury — it was a survival mechanism. Phoenix summers routinely push past 110 degrees Fahrenheit, and without climate control, professional baseball in the Sonoran Desert would be somewhere between miserable and medically dangerous. The retractable roof closes and the AC cranks during the brutal months, keeping the interior around a comfortable 78 degrees while the outside air could melt asphalt. During the cooler months — roughly late October through April — the roof opens to reveal clear Arizona skies, and the park transforms into a genuinely pleasant open-air experience.</p>

          <h3>The Pool</h3>
          <p>No feature at Chase Field gets more attention than the swimming pool and hot tub in right-center field. It is exactly what it sounds like: a full swimming pool where fans can watch the game from the water, drink in hand, with an unobstructed view of the playing field. Pool party tickets accommodate groups of up to 35 people and include food and beverages. The pool became iconic on the national stage when Mark Grace jumped in to celebrate the Diamondbacks' 2001 World Series victory. Home run balls have splashed into the pool on multiple occasions, creating some of the most uniquely Arizona highlights in baseball history. There is simply nothing else like it in professional sports.</p>

          <h3>The Dirt Strip</h3>
          <p>Chase Field is one of the last remaining ballparks in Major League Baseball that maintains a dirt strip — a continuous path of dirt running from the pitcher's mound to home plate. This old-school design element was once standard in every ballpark but has been phased out almost everywhere else in the modern era. The D-backs have kept it as a nod to tradition, and it gives the playing field a distinctive visual character that sets it apart from every other park in the league.</p>

          <h3>2001 World Series</h3>
          <p>Chase Field — then known as Bank One Ballpark — was the stage for one of the greatest World Series in baseball history. In 2001, the Diamondbacks faced the New York Yankees dynasty in a seven-game classic played just weeks after September 11th. Game 7 remains one of the most dramatic finishes in the sport's history: Luis Gonzalez's walk-off bloop single off Mariano Rivera in the bottom of the ninth inning gave Arizona the championship in only the franchise's fourth year of existence. The ghosts of that November night still echo through the building, and for D-backs fans, it remains the defining moment of the franchise.</p>

        <div class="content-block">
          <h2>Local Travel &amp; Nearby Attractions</h2>
          <p>Phoenix and the surrounding Valley of the Sun offer a striking landscape of desert beauty, Native American culture, and outdoor adventure. Here are the top spots to pair with your game day at Chase Field.</p>

          <div class="travel-card">
            <h3 class="travel-card__title">Desert Botanical Garden</h3>
            <p class="travel-card__distance">12 miles</p>
            <p class="travel-card__desc">A stunning 140-acre garden showcasing the extraordinary plant life of the Sonoran Desert. Towering saguaros, blooming wildflowers, and rare cacti from arid regions around the world line beautifully designed trails. The garden is famous for its rotating Chihuly glass art installations that blend seamlessly with the desert landscape. Sunset tours are particularly magical — the desert light turns golden and the silhouettes of the cacti against the fading sky are unforgettable. This is one of the finest botanical gardens in the country and an essential Phoenix experience.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="travel-card">
            <h3 class="travel-card__title">Heard Museum</h3>
            <p class="travel-card__distance">2 miles</p>
            <p class="travel-card__desc">A world-renowned museum dedicated to the art, history, and culture of Native American peoples of the Southwest and beyond. The Heard Museum's award-winning exhibitions explore everything from ancient pottery and textiles to contemporary Native American fine art. The permanent collection is extraordinary, and the museum provides deep, respectful context for the Indigenous cultures that have shaped this region for thousands of years. An easy visit from downtown Phoenix and absolutely worth your time.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="travel-card">
            <h3 class="travel-card__title">Papago Park &amp; Hole-in-the-Rock</h3>
            <p class="travel-card__distance">10 miles</p>
            <p class="travel-card__desc">A 1,500-acre desert park dominated by striking red sandstone buttes, including the iconic Hole-in-the-Rock formation — a natural geological opening in a red butte that offers panoramic views of the Phoenix skyline and surrounding mountains. The short hike to the hole is family-friendly and rewards you with one of the best photo opportunities in the Valley. The Phoenix Zoo is located within the park, making it easy to combine both into a half-day outing.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="travel-card">
            <h3 class="travel-card__title">Old Town Scottsdale</h3>
            <p class="travel-card__distance">12 miles</p>
            <p class="travel-card__desc">The cultural and entertainment heart of Scottsdale, packed with art galleries showcasing Southwestern and contemporary works, boutique shops, Southwestern jewelry and craft stores, and some of the best restaurants and nightlife in the Phoenix metro area. The Thursday night ArtWalk is a beloved tradition. After dark, the entertainment district comes alive with bars, lounges, and a vibrant social scene that draws visitors from across the Valley.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="travel-card">
            <h3 class="travel-card__title">Camelback Mountain</h3>
            <p class="travel-card__distance">10 miles</p>
            <p class="travel-card__desc">The most iconic hiking destination in the Phoenix area. The mountain's distinctive camel-shaped profile rises above the surrounding city, and the summit offers panoramic 360-degree views of the entire Valley of the Sun. Two trails reach the top: Echo Canyon, a steep and strenuous scramble with sections of rock climbing, and Cholla Trail, slightly longer but equally challenging. Both trails are demanding in the desert heat, so start early in the morning, bring far more water than you think you need, and avoid hiking during the summer months entirely.</p>

        </div>

        <!-- Getting There -->
        <div class="content-block">
          <h2>Getting There</h2>
          <h3>Valley Metro Rail</h3>
          <p>The Valley Metro light rail system stops at 3rd Street and Jefferson, which puts you directly at Chase Field's doorstep. The rail line runs from Mesa through Tempe and downtown Phoenix, connecting to Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport along the way. On game days, the light rail is the easiest and least stressful way to reach the park. Trains run frequently, and the ride from Tempe or the airport area takes roughly 20 to 30 minutes.</p>
          <h3>Driving</h3>
          <p>Chase Field is located at the junction of I-10 and I-17 in downtown Phoenix, making it accessible from virtually anywhere in the Valley. However, freeway traffic during rush hour can be heavy, and game-day congestion around the downtown exits adds time. If you are driving, plan to arrive at least 45 minutes before first pitch to account for traffic and parking.</p>
          <h3>Parking</h3>
          <p>Several large parking garages are located within a few blocks of the stadium in downtown Phoenix. Prices on game days typically range from $10 to $25 depending on proximity. The downtown grid is straightforward to navigate, and most garages are well-signed on game days. Pre-booking through a parking app is recommended for weekend games and popular matchups.</p>

          <h2>Fan Tips</h2>
          <div class="tip-box">
            <p class="tip-box__label">Insider Tips</p>
            <p>The air conditioning inside Chase Field makes summer games not just bearable but genuinely comfortable. Do not let the Phoenix heat scare you away from a summer visit — once you are inside the park with the roof closed, you will barely remember it is 115 degrees outside. It is one of the most climate-controlled baseball experiences in the sport.</p>
            <p>The churro dog is the signature food item at Chase Field and one of the most talked-about ballpark foods in all of baseball. It is a cinnamon churro nestled inside a chocolate-glazed donut, topped with frozen yogurt, whipped cream, chocolate sauce, and crushed candy. It is absurd, messy, photogenic, and absolutely worth trying at least once. You did not come to a baseball game to eat healthy.</p>
            <p>Pool party tickets are one of the most unique experiences in professional sports. If you can get a group together and book in advance, watching a game from a swimming pool in right-center field is a bucket-list baseball experience that simply does not exist anywhere else. These tickets sell out fast, so plan ahead.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <!-- Honest Drawbacks -->
        <div class="content-block">
          <h2>Honest Drawbacks</h2>
          <div class="drawback-box">
            <p class="drawback-box__label">Worth Knowing</p>
            <p>Chase Field has an artificial turf playing surface, and for baseball purists, that is a significant mark against it. The ball bounces differently off turf, the field lacks the organic beauty of natural grass, and it gives the park an aesthetic that feels more utilitarian than classic. In a sport that increasingly values real grass, the turf stands out — and not in a good way.</p>
            <p>The stadium opened in 1998 and is showing its age. While it was a marvel of engineering when it debuted, the interior concourses, seating areas, and overall design feel dated compared to newer parks. There have been ongoing discussions about renovations, but as it stands, Chase Field lacks the polish and modern amenities of recently built or recently renovated ballparks around the league.</p>
            <p>Downtown Phoenix can feel surprisingly quiet and empty after business hours. Unlike cities where the ballpark neighborhood buzzes with pre-game and post-game energy, the blocks surrounding Chase Field can feel deserted on non-game nights. The restaurant and bar scene in the immediate vicinity is improving, but it does not compare to the walkable entertainment districts around parks in San Diego, Denver, or Baltimore.</p>
            <p>The walk from your car or the light rail to the park during summer can be genuinely punishing. Even a ten-minute walk in 110-degree Phoenix heat with direct desert sun is uncomfortable and potentially dangerous for those not acclimated. Bring water, wear a hat, and do not underestimate the intensity of the Arizona summer sun. The AC inside the park is a relief, but getting there is the hard part.</p>
