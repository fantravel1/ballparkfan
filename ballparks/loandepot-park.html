          "text": "Yes, loanDepot park has a retractable roof that is essential for baseball in South Florida. Miami's climate brings intense summer heat, oppressive humidity, and sudden afternoon thunderstorms that can roll in without much warning, particularly from June through October. The retractable roof allows the Marlins to close the stadium and run the air conditioning during the hottest and wettest months, keeping fans cool and dry regardless of what is happening outside. When the weather cooperates — typically during the spring months and into early summer evenings — the roof opens to let in the warm Miami breeze and the night sky, and those open-roof games are genuinely pleasant. The roof operation takes about 15 minutes to open or close and can be adjusted between innings if weather conditions change suddenly during a game."

Versailles Restaurant on Calle Ocho is the undisputed landmark — a sprawling Cuban institution that has been serving cafecito, croquetas, ropa vieja, and media noche sandwiches since 1971. The ventanita (walk-up window) at Versailles is a cultural experience unto itself. Along Calle Ocho (SW 8th Street), you will find dozens of Cuban bakeries, fruit stands, and cafeterias serving everything from pastelitos to lechon asado. Inside the park itself, the Cuban sandwich is a must — pressed ham, roasted pork, Swiss cheese, pickles, and mustard on Cuban bread. Pair it with a cafecito or a cortadito for the full Miami experience. The neighborhood's food scene is authentic, affordable, and unlike anything you will find near any other ballpark in Major League Baseball."

          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "loanDepot park's low attendance is a well-known issue in Major League Baseball and stems from a combination of factors that have compounded over the years. The Marlins have historically struggled to build and maintain a loyal fanbase, in part because of ownership decisions that alienated fans — most notably, the fire sales of talented rosters after the 1997 and 2003 World Series championships, when the team was dismantled almost immediately after winning it all. Miami is also a famously fickle sports market where fans tend to rally around winning teams and stay home when the product on the field is not competitive. The stadium's location in Little Havana, while culturally rich, is not easily accessible by public transit and sits outside the areas where many potential fans live and work. Competition for entertainment dollars in Miami is fierce, with beaches, nightlife, and year-round outdoor activities providing alternatives that most cities cannot match. The result is a ballpark that often feels empty, though the silver lining for visiting fans is that tickets are among the cheapest in baseball and you can often move to excellent seats."

        <!-- What Makes loanDepot park Special -->
        <div class="content-block">
          <h2>What Makes loanDepot park Special</h2>
          <p>loanDepot park is unlike any other stadium in Major League Baseball — a building that feels unmistakably, unapologetically Miami from the moment you walk through the gates. The retractable roof is the park's most critical feature, and it is not a luxury here — it is a necessity. South Florida summers bring punishing heat, thick humidity, and violent afternoon thunderstorms that can drench a neighborhood in minutes and vanish just as quickly. The roof allows the Marlins to guarantee a comfortable, climate-controlled experience regardless of what Miami's weather decides to do on any given afternoon. When conditions cooperate, particularly on spring evenings and early summer nights, the roof slides open to reveal warm tropical air and a sky that turns shades of pink and orange over the Miami skyline. Those open-roof games are some of the most pleasant outdoor baseball experiences in the sport.</p>

          <h3>The Aquariums</h3>
          <p>Behind home plate, two massive floor-to-ceiling saltwater aquariums flank the backstop, filled with tropical fish, rays, and other marine life native to South Florida waters. They are stunning, unexpected, and completely unique in professional sports. The tanks hold a combined 450 gallons of saltwater and are maintained by a dedicated aquarium team. Watching a pitch cross the plate with colorful fish swimming lazily behind the batter is a visual unlike anything else in baseball. The aquariums have become one of the most photographed features of the park and a genuine conversation piece — a reminder that this is Miami, where even the baseball stadium has an ocean influence.</p>

          <h3>The Swimming Pool</h3>
          <p>Beyond the left-field wall sits a swimming pool area that can be reserved for groups. Like the pool at Chase Field in Arizona, it offers a decidedly non-traditional way to watch a baseball game — lounging in the water with a drink in hand while home runs soar overhead. The pool area includes food and beverage service and provides a party atmosphere that captures the spirit of Miami nightlife. It is one of only two pools in all of Major League Baseball and one of the most sought-after group experiences at the park.</p>

          <h3>Miami Art and Color</h3>
          <p>The interior of loanDepot park is awash in color and art in a way that no other ballpark attempts. Vibrant murals, bold color palettes, and contemporary art installations are woven throughout the concourses, paying tribute to Miami's thriving arts scene and Latin American cultural roots. The design rejects the retro-brick aesthetic that dominates modern ballpark architecture and instead embraces Miami's identity — bright, tropical, loud, and unapologetic. Whether you love the aesthetic or find it over the top, there is no denying that loanDepot park has a visual personality that is entirely its own.</p>

          <h3>Little Havana and the Smallest Capacity in the NL</h3>
          <p>The park sits in the heart of Little Havana, Miami's most culturally significant Cuban-American neighborhood, and the surrounding streets pulse with the energy of Calle Ocho — cigar shops, domino players, cafecito windows, and the aroma of roasting pork. At 36,742 seats, loanDepot park has the smallest seating capacity in the National League, which gives it an intimacy that larger parks cannot replicate. Every seat feels close to the action, and even the upper-deck views are surprisingly good. The small footprint, combined with the park's distinctive personality, makes for a baseball experience that rewards fans who are willing to look past the attendance numbers and appreciate what makes this place genuinely different.</p>

        <div class="content-block">
          <h2>Local Travel &amp; Nearby Attractions</h2>
          <p>Miami is one of the most vibrant and culturally diverse cities in the United States, and the area surrounding loanDepot park offers world-class attractions that range from iconic beaches to the wild Everglades. Here are the top spots to pair with your game day.</p>

          <div class="travel-card">
            <h3 class="travel-card__title">Little Havana / Calle Ocho</h3>
            <p class="travel-card__distance">Adjacent</p>
            <p class="travel-card__desc">loanDepot park sits in the heart of Little Havana, and exploring this neighborhood before or after the game is an essential part of the experience. Calle Ocho (SW 8th Street) is the cultural spine of Miami's Cuban-American community, and walking its blocks is a sensory experience unlike anything near any other ballpark. Stop at a ventanita for a cafecito or cortadito — the small, powerful shots of Cuban espresso that fuel the entire city. Watch the old-timers play dominoes at Maximo Gomez Park (Domino Park), browse the hand-rolled cigars at one of the many cigar shops, and eat at Versailles — the legendary Cuban restaurant that has been a community gathering place since 1971. The street life here is vibrant, authentic, and deeply rooted in a culture that has shaped Miami into what it is today.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="travel-card">
            <h3 class="travel-card__title">South Beach &amp; Art Deco District</h3>
            <p class="travel-card__distance">8 miles</p>
            <p class="travel-card__desc">South Beach needs no introduction. The iconic stretch of Ocean Drive is lined with pastel-colored Art Deco buildings from the 1920s, 30s, and 40s — the largest collection of Art Deco architecture in the world. The beach itself is a wide, white-sand expanse that stretches for miles along the Atlantic, filled with sunbathers, volleyball players, and the unmistakable energy of one of the world's most famous beach scenes. The nightlife here is legendary, with rooftop bars, world-class restaurants, and clubs that do not start getting going until well past midnight. Even if the club scene is not your thing, walking the Art Deco Historic District at sunset is one of the great urban experiences in America.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="travel-card">
            <h3 class="travel-card__title">Wynwood Walls</h3>
            <p class="travel-card__distance">4 miles</p>
            <p class="travel-card__desc">Wynwood has transformed from an overlooked warehouse district into one of the most celebrated street art destinations on the planet. The Wynwood Walls — a curated outdoor museum of large-scale murals by artists from around the world — anchor the neighborhood, but the art extends for blocks in every direction, covering nearly every available surface with bold, colorful, and thought-provoking work. The surrounding Wynwood Arts District is packed with galleries, independent shops, craft breweries, and restaurants that range from casual taquerias to upscale tasting menus. Second Saturday Art Walks draw thousands of people into the streets. This is Miami's creative heartbeat, and it is an absolute must-visit.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="travel-card">
            <h3 class="travel-card__title">Vizcaya Museum &amp; Gardens</h3>
            <p class="travel-card__distance">6 miles</p>
            <p class="travel-card__desc">Vizcaya is a stunning Italian Renaissance-style villa built in the 1910s on the shores of Biscayne Bay by industrialist James Deering. The main house is filled with European antiques and decorative arts spanning four centuries, and the formal gardens are an extraordinary blend of Italian and French design featuring fountains, sculptures, and manicured hedges that tumble down toward the waterfront. The property feels completely out of place in modern Miami, which is precisely what makes it so captivating. The views across Biscayne Bay from the gardens are breathtaking, and the entire estate offers a glimpse into a gilded era of American wealth that feels worlds away from the ballpark just a few miles north.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="travel-card">
            <h3 class="travel-card__title">Everglades National Park</h3>
            <p class="travel-card__distance">40 miles</p>
            <p class="travel-card__desc">The Everglades are one of the most unique ecosystems on Earth — a vast, slow-moving river of grass that covers the southern tip of Florida and supports an astonishing diversity of wildlife. Airboat tours will take you skimming across the sawgrass marshes, where you will see alligators sunning themselves on the banks, wading birds stalking fish in the shallows, and mangrove tunnels that feel like another world entirely. The park is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and an International Biosphere Reserve, and it is closer to downtown Miami than most people realize. A half-day trip from the city is enough to experience the airboat tours and the main visitor areas, making it an excellent day-trip addition to a Marlins road trip for anyone who wants to see wild Florida up close.</p>

        <!-- Getting There -->
        <div class="content-block">
          <h2>Getting There</h2>
          <h3>Public Transit</h3>
          <p>loanDepot park does not have a direct Metrorail station, which is one of the park's notable drawbacks. The closest Metrorail stations are Civic Center and Culmer, both of which require a bus connection or a roughly 20-minute walk to reach the stadium. Miami-Dade Transit operates bus routes that connect to the park, and on game days there are sometimes additional shuttle services, but the transit experience is not seamless. If you are relying on public transportation, plan extra time and check current routes before heading out.</p>
          <h3>Rideshare</h3>
          <p>Rideshare services like Uber and Lyft are the most popular and convenient way to reach loanDepot park for most visitors. Designated pickup and dropoff zones are located near the stadium entrances, and the ride from South Beach, downtown Miami, or the Brickell area typically takes 15 to 25 minutes depending on traffic. Given the parking situation and the lack of direct rail access, rideshare is genuinely the recommended option for most fans visiting the park.</p>
          <h3>Driving and Parking</h3>
          <p>loanDepot park is accessible from I-95 and the Dolphin Expressway (State Road 836), and the stadium is well-signed from both highways. Several parking structures and surface lots surround the park, with prices typically ranging from $15 to $30 on game days. Traffic flow on game days is generally manageable given the Marlins' modest attendance, and you are unlikely to encounter the gridlock that plagues larger-market parks. Arriving 30 to 45 minutes before first pitch is usually sufficient to park and walk in comfortably.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Fan Tips -->
        <div class="content-block">
          <h2>Fan Tips</h2>
          <div class="tip-box">
            <p class="tip-box__label">Insider Tips</p>
            <p>Get a Cuban sandwich and a cafecito inside the park. The Cuban sandwich at loanDepot park is one of the best ballpark food items in all of baseball — pressed pork, ham, Swiss, pickles, and mustard on authentic Cuban bread. Pair it with a small, powerful shot of cafecito and you have the most Miami meal imaginable. Skip the generic hot dogs. You are in Little Havana. Eat accordingly.</p>
            <p>Roof-open games have a wonderful tropical breeze that flows through the stadium, and evening games with the roof open are some of the most pleasant baseball-watching experiences in the sport. Check the forecast before your visit and hope for a roof-open night — the warm air, the sound of the city, and the Miami sky overhead transform the experience from a generic indoor ballgame into something genuinely special.</p>
            <p>Tickets to Marlins games are among the most affordable in all of Major League Baseball. You can often find excellent seats for surprisingly low prices, especially on weeknights. This is one of the best value propositions in the sport — a modern, climate-controlled stadium with great sightlines, and you can sit close to the action for a fraction of what comparable seats would cost at Yankee Stadium or Fenway Park.</p>
            <p>Arrive early and explore Little Havana before the game. Walk Calle Ocho, grab a cafecito at a ventanita, watch the domino players, and soak in the neighborhood. The cultural experience of Little Havana is honestly as memorable as the game itself, and most visitors to loanDepot park never bother to explore it. Do not make that mistake.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <!-- Honest Drawbacks -->
        <div class="content-block">
          <h2>Honest Drawbacks</h2>
          <div class="drawback-box">
            <p class="drawback-box__label">Worth Knowing</p>
            <p>Attendance at loanDepot park is sparse, and there is no way to sugarcoat it. The Marlins routinely rank near the bottom of Major League Baseball in attendance, and on weeknight games the stadium can feel cavernously empty. The upside is that you will have plenty of space, can spread out freely, and will never feel crowded. But the atmosphere suffers, and the energy that a packed ballpark generates is simply not present for most Marlins games. If you thrive on the roar of a sellout crowd, you may find the experience underwhelming.</p>
            <p>There is no direct rail access to the stadium. Unlike parks in cities with robust transit systems, getting to loanDepot park without a car requires bus connections or a rideshare. The Metrorail does not stop at the park, and the bus connections are not always intuitive for visitors unfamiliar with the Miami-Dade transit system. This is a genuine inconvenience, particularly for tourists staying in South Beach or downtown who do not want to deal with driving and parking.</p>
            <p>The Marlins have historically struggled to build and maintain a loyal fanbase. Ownership decisions over the years — including the dismantling of championship rosters in 1997 and 2003, and the controversial public financing of the stadium itself — have eroded trust with the local community. The team's competitive struggles in many recent seasons have compounded the problem. The result is a franchise that plays in a world-class city but has not yet figured out how to consistently fill its beautiful park.</p>
            <p>The neighborhood surrounding loanDepot park, while culturally rich, is not walkable from the tourist areas where most visitors stay. Little Havana is wonderful for a pre-game visit, but if you are staying in South Beach, Brickell, or downtown, you are looking at a drive or rideshare to reach the park. There is no surrounding entertainment district with bars and restaurants within easy walking distance of the gates, which means the pre-game and post-game experience requires some planning.</p>

              <div class="faq-answer" itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer">
                <p itemprop="text">Yes, loanDepot park has a retractable roof that is essential for baseball in South Florida. Miami's climate brings intense summer heat, oppressive humidity, and sudden afternoon thunderstorms that can roll in without much warning, particularly from June through October. The retractable roof allows the Marlins to close the stadium and run the air conditioning during the hottest and wettest months, keeping fans cool and dry regardless of what is happening outside. When the weather cooperates — typically during the spring months and into early summer evenings — the roof opens to let in the warm Miami breeze and the night sky, and those open-roof games are genuinely pleasant. The roof operation takes about 15 minutes to open or close and can be adjusted between innings if weather conditions change suddenly during a game.</p>

              <summary itemprop="name">What should I eat near loanDepot park?</summary>
              <div class="faq-answer" itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer">
                <p itemprop="text">loanDepot park sits in the heart of Little Havana, one of the most iconic food neighborhoods in the United States, and eating before or after the game here is an essential part of the experience. Versailles Restaurant on Calle Ocho is the undisputed landmark — a sprawling Cuban institution that has been serving cafecito, croquetas, ropa vieja, and media noche sandwiches since 1971. The ventanita (walk-up window) at Versailles is a cultural experience unto itself. Along Calle Ocho (SW 8th Street), you will find dozens of Cuban bakeries, fruit stands, and cafeterias serving everything from pastelitos to lechon asado. Inside the park itself, the Cuban sandwich is a must — pressed ham, roasted pork, Swiss cheese, pickles, and mustard on Cuban bread. Pair it with a cafecito or a cortadito for the full Miami experience. The neighborhood's food scene is authentic, affordable, and unlike anything you will find near any other ballpark in Major League Baseball.</p>

              <summary itemprop="name">Why is loanDepot park attendance so low?</summary>
              <div class="faq-answer" itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer">
                <p itemprop="text">loanDepot park's low attendance is a well-known issue in Major League Baseball and stems from a combination of factors that have compounded over the years. The Marlins have historically struggled to build and maintain a loyal fanbase, in part because of ownership decisions that alienated fans — most notably, the fire sales of talented rosters after the 1997 and 2003 World Series championships, when the team was dismantled almost immediately after winning it all. Miami is also a famously fickle sports market where fans tend to rally around winning teams and stay home when the product on the field is not competitive. The stadium's location in Little Havana, while culturally rich, is not easily accessible by public transit and sits outside the areas where many potential fans live and work. Competition for entertainment dollars in Miami is fierce, with beaches, nightlife, and year-round outdoor activities providing alternatives that most cities cannot match. The result is a ballpark that often feels empty, though the silver lining for visiting fans is that tickets are among the cheapest in baseball and you can often move to excellent seats.</p>
