        <!-- What Makes Fenway Park Special -->
        <div class="content-block">
          <h2>What Makes Fenway Park Special</h2>
          <p>Fenway Park is not just a baseball stadium — it is a living monument to the sport itself. Opened on April 20, 1912, the same week the Titanic sank, Fenway is the oldest active ballpark in Major League Baseball. Its most iconic feature is the Green Monster, the 37-foot-2-inch left field wall that towers over the playing field and turns routine fly balls into doubles or keeps would-be home runs in the park. The manual scoreboard embedded inside the Monster is still operated by hand during every game, with operators using 13-pound metal number plates to post scores from around the league — one of the last parks in baseball to do it this way.</p>
          <p>Down the right field line stands Pesky's Pole, the foul pole named after Red Sox legend Johnny Pesky, who was said to have wrapped several of his rare home runs around it at a distance of just 302 feet from home plate. That short porch, combined with the Monster in left and the odd triangle in center field, gives Fenway some of the most unusual dimensions in baseball. No two walls are the same height, no two angles are predictable, and outfielders who play here need years to master the caroms.</p>
          <p>What truly sets Fenway apart is its intimacy. With a capacity of only 37,755, it is the smallest park in the majors. There is not a bad seat in the house when it comes to feeling close to the action — the foul territory is tiny, putting fans almost on top of the field. On a summer night, with the crowd packed in shoulder to shoulder, the roar bouncing off century-old concrete and steel, Fenway delivers an intensity that the cavernous modern ballparks simply cannot match. This is a place where generations of families have sat in the same seats, where the "Sweet Caroline" singalong in the eighth inning has become a ritual, and where baseball history is not displayed in a museum — it is the building itself.</p>

            <p class="travel-card__desc">The blocks surrounding the ballpark are a destination in their own right. Lansdowne Street is lined with bars and live music venues, including the House of Blues. Bleacher Bar, built directly into the center field bleachers, lets you watch the field through a garage-door window — grab a drink there before the game. The neighborhood is energetic, walkable, and packed on game days.</p>

Adjacent to it is the Public Garden, famous for its Swan Boats that have been operating since 1877. Together, they form a beautiful green space right in the heart of the city, perfect for a pre-game walk or a morning stroll the day after.</p>

        <!-- Getting There -->
        <div class="content-block">
          <h2>Getting There</h2>
          <h3>MBTA Green Line</h3>
          <p>The easiest way to reach Fenway Park is the MBTA Green Line. Take the B, C, or D branch to Kenmore station, which puts you about a five-minute walk from the park gates. The D branch also stops at Fenway station, slightly closer to the third-base side entrances. On game days, the T runs extra service and the trains are packed — give yourself extra time.</p>
          <h3>Parking</h3>
          <p>Parking near Fenway is limited and expensive, often $40-$60 in nearby lots on game days. If you must drive, look for garages in the Prudential Center or Back Bay area and walk to the park. Pre-booking a spot through a parking app can save money and guarantee availability. Street parking in the Fenway-Kenmore neighborhood is resident-only on game days.</p>
          <h3>Rideshare Drop-off</h3>
          <p>Uber and Lyft have a designated drop-off zone on Brookline Avenue near the park. After the game, expect surge pricing and long waits — consider walking a few blocks toward Kenmore Square or Brookline Avenue to find a faster pickup. Many fans find it easier to take the T after the game and rideshare from a less congested stop.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Fan Tips -->
        <div class="content-block">
          <h2>Fan Tips</h2>
          <div class="tip-box">
            <p class="tip-box__label">Best Seats</p>
            <p>For the quintessential Fenway experience, splurge on Green Monster seats atop the left field wall — the view of the park and the city skyline is unforgettable. If the budget is tighter, the right field grandstand (sections 1-9) offers excellent sightlines at more reasonable prices. Avoid Grandstand sections 13-33 on the third-base side if you are sensitive to obstructed views from support poles.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="tip-box">
            <p class="tip-box__label">Food Recommendations</p>
            <p>The Fenway Frank is a non-negotiable — it has been the park's signature food since opening day. For something more substantial, grab a cup of clam chowder from the Legal Sea Foods stand. The Italian sausage carts on Lansdowne Street outside the park are a beloved pre-game tradition. Inside, look for the lobster roll stands and local craft beers from Samuel Adams and Harpoon.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="tip-box">
            <p class="tip-box__label">Arrive Early</p>
            <p>Gates open 90 minutes before first pitch. Arriving early lets you watch batting practice from up close, explore the park's historic features without fighting crowds, and grab food before the lines build up. Walk the entire concourse — Fenway rewards fans who explore its quirky corners, old photographs, and retired number displays.</p>

        <!-- Honest Drawbacks -->
        <div class="content-block">
          <h2>Honest Drawbacks</h2>
          <div class="drawback-box">
            <p class="drawback-box__label">Cramped Seating</p>
            <p>Fenway was built in 1912, and the seats reflect it. Many grandstand seats are narrow, with minimal legroom — if you are tall or broad-shouldered, you will feel squeezed. The wooden seats in the older sections have no cup holders, and the rows are close together. It is part of the old-time charm, but comfort-wise it trails every modern ballpark.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="drawback-box">
            <p class="drawback-box__label">Obstructed Views</p>
            <p>Support poles throughout the grandstand sections partially block the view of the field from certain seats. The Red Sox label these seats as "obstructed view" and sell them at a discount, but they can still be frustrating. Always check seat maps carefully before buying, and avoid Grandstand sections in the upper rows behind poles if clear sightlines matter to you.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="drawback-box">
            <p class="drawback-box__label">Expensive Tickets</p>
            <p>Fenway Park has the smallest capacity in MLB, and the Red Sox have one of the most devoted fanbases in baseball. That combination means ticket prices are among the highest in the league. Even upper bleacher seats can run $40-$60, and premium seating regularly exceeds $200. Check resale sites on weekday games against less popular opponents for the best value.</p>
