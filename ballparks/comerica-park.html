        <!-- What Makes Comerica Park Special -->
        <div class="content-block" id="park-heading">
          <h2>What Makes Comerica Park Special</h2>
          <p>Comerica Park announces itself before you even walk through the gates. Massive tiger sculptures flank the main entrance on Woodward Avenue, their stainless-steel forms crouching and prowling as if guarding the ballpark. Giant baseball bats made of painted steel lean against the brick facade. This is a stadium that does not do subtlety, and that is part of the charm.</p>
          <p>Inside, the most recognizable feature is the Ferris wheel rising above the left-field concourse. Standing 50 feet tall with cars shaped like baseballs, it gives riders a panoramic view of the playing field and the Detroit skyline beyond. Next to it sits a full-size carousel decorated with hand-painted tigers. These are not gimmicks -- they are what make Comerica Park one of the most genuinely family-friendly ballparks in the majors. Kids love this place.</p>
          <p>The liquid fireworks fountain show is another signature. Located in center field, the choreographed water display erupts after home runs and between innings, shooting jets of illuminated water high into the air. On a summer night under the lights, it is a real spectacle.</p>
          <p>Beyond the outfield fence, the Detroit skyline fills the backdrop -- a visual reminder that this ballpark sits in the absolute center of the city, right on Woodward Avenue, the main artery that has defined Detroit since the city's founding. The views of downtown towers against the evening sky give Comerica Park an urban energy that many newer stadiums lack.</p>
          <p>Near the home plate entrance, a statue of Al Kaline -- Mr. Tiger himself, the Hall of Famer who spent his entire 22-year career in Detroit -- stands as a tribute to the franchise's greatest player. The statues of other Tigers legends line the outfield concourse, connecting the current team to a deep baseball history that stretches back over a century.</p>

        <!-- Local Travel & Nearby Attractions -->
        <div class="content-block">
          <h2>Local Travel &amp; Nearby Attractions</h2>
          <p>Detroit is a city with far more to offer visitors than most people realize. Comerica Park sits in the middle of a downtown that has undergone a remarkable revival, with world-class museums, historic markets, and iconic cultural landmarks all within easy reach.</p>

          <div class="travel-card">
            <h3 class="travel-card__title">Detroit Institute of Arts</h3>
            <p class="travel-card__distance">0.5 miles</p>
            <p class="travel-card__desc">One of the finest art museums in the United States, home to Diego Rivera's iconic Detroit Industry murals -- a jaw-dropping, room-spanning fresco cycle depicting the city's industrial might. The collection also includes Van Gogh, Rembrandt, and an outstanding American art wing. General admission is free for residents of Wayne, Oakland, and Macomb counties, making this one of the great cultural bargains in America. Even if you are visiting from out of town, the admission fee is modest for a world-class collection of this caliber.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="travel-card">
            <h3 class="travel-card__title">Motown Museum</h3>
            <p class="travel-card__distance">2 miles</p>
            <p class="travel-card__desc">Hitsville U.S.A. -- the modest blue house on West Grand Boulevard where Berry Gordy founded Motown Records and changed American music forever. Tour Studio A, the tiny recording space where Stevie Wonder, the Supremes, Marvin Gaye, and the Temptations laid down some of the most important records in pop history. The museum is intimate, emotional, and unmissable. Book your tour in advance as it sells out regularly.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="travel-card">
            <h3 class="travel-card__title">Ford Field</h3>
            <p class="travel-card__distance">Adjacent</p>
            <p class="travel-card__desc">Home of the Detroit Lions, Ford Field sits directly next to Comerica Park and the two stadiums are connected by a pedestrian walkway. If you are visiting during football season, catching a Lions game alongside a Tigers game makes for an incredible Detroit sports weekend. Tours of Ford Field are also available on non-game days, offering a behind-the-scenes look at the indoor stadium.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="travel-card">
            <h3 class="travel-card__title">Eastern Market</h3>
            <p class="travel-card__distance">1.5 miles</p>
            <p class="travel-card__desc">A historic public market operating since 1891 and one of the largest year-round markets in the United States. The Saturday farmers market is the main event -- a sprawling, vibrant scene of local produce, flowers, meat, cheese, and prepared food vendors spread across multiple open-air sheds. The surrounding streets are covered in massive murals, making the whole district feel like an outdoor gallery. Food vendors serve everything from tacos to pierogies.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="travel-card">
            <h3 class="travel-card__title">Detroit Riverwalk</h3>
            <p class="travel-card__distance">1 mile</p>
            <p class="travel-card__desc">A beautifully designed 3.5-mile waterfront promenade stretching along the Detroit River with views across the water to Windsor, Canada. The walk passes the GM Renaissance Center, public plazas, gardens, and the Outdoor Adventure Center. It is one of the best urban riverwalks in the country and a perfect way to spend a few hours before a game. On a clear day, you can see all the way across the international border.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <!-- Getting There -->
        <div class="content-block">
          <h2>Getting There</h2>
          <h3>QLine Streetcar</h3>
          <p>The QLine streetcar runs along Woodward Avenue and stops directly at Comerica Park. It is the easiest and most scenic way to reach the ballpark from midtown or the New Center area. The streetcar runs frequently on game days, and riding it down Woodward gives you a front-row view of Detroit's revitalized main street.</p>

          <h3>People Mover</h3>
          <p>Detroit's elevated People Mover loops through downtown with a stop at Grand Circus Park, which is a short walk from Comerica Park. It is an affordable and efficient option if you are staying in the downtown core or arriving from one of the downtown hotels.</p>

          <h3>Driving &amp; Parking</h3>
          <p>Comerica Park is easily accessible from I-75 (Fisher Freeway), with well-signed exits directing you to the ballpark. Multiple parking structures and surface lots surround the stadium, typically ranging from $15 to $40 depending on proximity and demand. The Comerica Park garages on Montcalm Street fill up fast, so arriving early or choosing a garage a few blocks further out is a smart move.</p>

          <h3>Walkability</h3>
          <p>If you are staying anywhere in downtown Detroit or the Greektown district, Comerica Park is an easy walk. Greektown, with its restaurants and casino, is just a few blocks east. The entire area around Woodward Avenue is pedestrian-friendly on game days, with plenty of bars and restaurants within walking distance for pre-game food and drinks.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Fan Tips -->
        <div class="content-block">
          <h2>Fan Tips</h2>
          <div class="tip-box">
            <p class="tip-box__label">Insider Tips</p>
            <p>Ride the Ferris wheel during the game for an unforgettable view of the field and the Detroit skyline -- it is one of the most unique vantage points in all of baseball. For food, get a coney dog and pick a side in the great Detroit debate: American Coney Island or Lafayette Coney Island (both downtown institutions worth visiting before or after the game). If you are bringing kids, arrive early so they have time to ride the carousel and explore the tiger sculptures around the main entrance. The outfield concourse is wide and open, making it easy to walk the entire park without missing the action.</p>
          </div>

        <!-- Honest Drawbacks -->
        <div class="content-block">
          <h2>Honest Drawbacks</h2>
          <div class="drawback-box">
            <p class="drawback-box__label">Worth Knowing</p>
            <p>Comerica Park has one of the largest playing fields in Major League Baseball, which means fewer home runs and more balls dying in the spacious outfield. If you love seeing the ball fly out of the park, this is not always the place for it. Some areas around the stadium, while improving rapidly, are still in the process of recovering from decades of disinvestment -- Detroit's revival is real but uneven, and a few blocks in any direction can feel very different. Early-season games in April and even May can be genuinely cold, with frigid winds coming off the Great Lakes. Dress in layers and bring a jacket even if the forecast looks mild.</p>
