      <!-- What Makes Kauffman Stadium Special -->
      <section class="content-block" aria-labelledby="what-makes-special">
        <h2 id="what-makes-special">What Makes Kauffman Stadium Special</h2>
        <p>Kauffman Stadium is a throwback in the best possible sense. Opened in 1973 as Royals Stadium, it was one of the first facilities in America built exclusively for baseball at a time when every other city was building cookie-cutter multipurpose stadiums. More than fifty years later, the design still works. It is a stadium that knew what it wanted to be from the beginning, and it has never wavered.</p>

        <h3>The Largest Water Feature in Professional Sports</h3>
        <p>The 322-foot fountain complex beyond the right-center field fence is the signature feature of Kauffman Stadium and the largest water feature of any professional sports venue in the world. The fountains erupt during player introductions, after home runs, and at key moments throughout the game, sending jets of water cascading skyward while illuminated with colored lights at night. They are mesmerizing. Whether you are sitting in the upper deck or standing along the outfield concourse, the fountains are always in view, always in motion, and always spectacular. No other ballpark has anything like them.</p>

        <h3>The Crown Scoreboard</h3>
        <p>Rising above center field, the crown-shaped scoreboard is the other defining visual element of Kauffman Stadium. It is a direct reference to the team's name, and it has become one of the most recognizable structures in all of baseball. The crown was part of the original 1973 design, updated during the stadium's renovation, and remains the focal point of the skyline from inside the park. On a summer night, lit up against the dark Missouri sky, it is unmistakable.</p>

        <h3>A Classic 1970s Design That Still Works</h3>
        <p>When Kauffman Stadium opened, the trend in American sports was to build concrete donuts that could host football and baseball in the same venue. Kansas City went in a completely different direction. The Truman Sports Complex placed the baseball stadium and the football stadium side by side but as separate, purpose-built facilities. Kauffman's sweeping curves, open outfield, and clean sightlines were ahead of their time. The bones of the original design are so strong that a major renovation in 2009 modernized the concourses and amenities while preserving everything that made the park special in the first place.</p>

        <h3>A Dedicated Baseball-Only Stadium</h3>
        <p>Kauffman Stadium was built for baseball and nothing else. There is no football configuration, no compromised sightlines, no awkward multipurpose geometry. Every seat faces the diamond. Every angle was designed for watching a baseball game. In an era when that was a radical concept, Kansas City got it right, and the intimacy and focus of the experience reflects that commitment decades later.</p>

        <h3>The George Brett Statue and Royals Hall of Fame</h3>
        <p>The bronze statue of George Brett stands outside the stadium, capturing the Hall of Famer in his iconic batting stance. Brett spent his entire 21-year career with the Royals, won the 1980 AL MVP, flirted with .400 in that same legendary season, and remains the greatest player in franchise history. Inside the park, the Royals Hall of Fame celebrates the history of the franchise, from the 1985 World Series championship to the 2015 title run. It is a reminder that this franchise, while often overshadowed by bigger-market teams, has produced moments and players that belong in any conversation about baseball history.</p>

        <h2 id="nearby-attractions">Local Travel</h2>
        <p>Kansas City is one of the most underrated cities in America, with world-class barbecue, outstanding museums, and a character that surprises first-time visitors. The stadium sits in a suburban location east of downtown, so you will want to explore the city before heading to the game.</p>

        <div class="travel-card">
          <h3 class="travel-card__title">National World War I Museum &amp; Memorial</h3>
          <p class="travel-card__distance">8 miles</p>
          <p class="travel-card__desc">The best World War I museum in the world, and it is right here in Kansas City. Designated by Congress as the nation's official WWI museum, the collection is staggering in scope and deeply moving in its presentation. The Liberty Memorial tower rises 217 feet above the grounds and offers panoramic views of the Kansas City skyline in every direction. The museum itself takes you through the entire history of the Great War with artifacts, immersive exhibits, and a glass bridge over a field of nine million red poppies representing every life lost. Allow at least three hours. It is worth every minute.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="travel-card">
          <h3 class="travel-card__title">Kansas City BBQ Trail</h3>
          <p class="travel-card__distance">Citywide</p>
          <p class="travel-card__desc">Kansas City is the BBQ capital of the world, and this is not an exaggeration. The city has more than a hundred barbecue restaurants, and the top tier is extraordinary. Joe's Kansas City Bar-B-Que, housed inside a gas station, serves the legendary Z-Man sandwich and is a perennial contender for best barbecue in America. Q39 brings a more refined approach with exceptional burnt ends and ribs. Gates Bar-B-Q is a Kansas City institution where the staff shouts "Hi, may I help you?" the instant you walk through the door. Arthur Bryant's, near the 18th and Vine district, is the granddaddy of them all, the place that served presidents and defined KC-style barbecue. Do not limit yourself to one. This is a city that demands a barbecue crawl.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="travel-card">
          <h3 class="travel-card__title">Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art</h3>
          <p class="travel-card__distance">7 miles</p>
          <p class="travel-card__desc">One of the finest art museums in the Midwest, and admission is completely free. The Nelson-Atkins is instantly recognizable by the giant Shuttlecocks sculptures on its front lawn -- four oversized badminton birdies by Claes Oldenburg and Coosje van Bruggen that have become a beloved Kansas City landmark. Inside, the collection spans thousands of years, from Old Masters and Asian art to a strong contemporary wing. The Bloch Building addition is an architectural marvel of translucent glass panels that glow at night. A world-class museum that would be a flagship attraction in any city, and Kansas City gives it away for free.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="travel-card">
          <h3 class="travel-card__title">Country Club Plaza</h3>
          <p class="travel-card__distance">8 miles</p>
          <p class="travel-card__desc">The Country Club Plaza is one of the first planned outdoor shopping districts in America, opened in 1923 and inspired by the architecture of Seville, Spain. The buildings are covered in ornamental tile work, the streets are lined with fountains and sculptures, and the overall effect is unlike any other shopping district in the country. Beyond the shops, the Plaza is home to excellent restaurants, sidewalk cafes, and a lively atmosphere that makes it perfect for an afternoon or evening stroll before heading to the game. Kansas City has more fountains than any city except Rome, and many of the best ones are right here.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="travel-card">
          <h3 class="travel-card__title">Negro Leagues Baseball Museum</h3>
          <p class="travel-card__distance">7 miles</p>
          <p class="travel-card__desc">Essential baseball history, located in the heart of the historic 18th and Vine jazz district. Kansas City was home to the Monarchs, one of the greatest teams in Negro Leagues history, and this museum tells the story of the players, teams, and leagues that thrived when baseball was segregated. The legacy of Buck O'Neil, the beloved Monarchs first baseman and manager who became one of baseball's greatest ambassadors, is woven throughout the museum. The Field of Legends exhibit, with life-size bronze statues of Negro Leagues legends positioned on an indoor diamond, is unforgettable. If you love baseball, this museum is not optional. It is a pilgrimage.</p>

      <!-- Getting There -->
      <section class="content-block" aria-labelledby="getting-there">
        <h2 id="getting-there">Getting There</h2>
        <p>Kauffman Stadium sits at the Truman Sports Complex in a suburban area east of downtown Kansas City, at the intersection of Interstate 70 and Interstate 435. A car is essentially required. There is no rail service to the stadium, and bus options are extremely limited on game days. This is a drive-in ballpark in every sense.</p>
        <p>The good news is that parking is abundant and straightforward. The Truman Sports Complex has massive surface parking lots that surround the stadium, and while they fill up on popular game nights, you will almost always find a spot. Arrive early to secure closer parking and to soak in the tailgating atmosphere -- Royals fans take their pre-game parking lot gatherings seriously, with grills fired up and lawn chairs out hours before first pitch.</p>
        <p>Rideshare services like Uber and Lyft are a solid option, particularly if you want to hit the barbecue trail before the game and avoid driving. The designated pickup and drop-off areas at the sports complex are well-organized, and post-game wait times are generally reasonable by major league standards. Just be aware that the stadium's suburban location means the ride from downtown will take 15 to 20 minutes depending on traffic.</p>

        <div class="tip-box">
          <p class="tip-box__label">Insider Tips</p>
          <p>Eat barbecue before the game, not inside the stadium. Kansas City has the best barbecue on the planet, and the concession stands at Kauffman Stadium, while decent, cannot compete with Joe's KC, Q39, Gates, or Arthur Bryant's. Hit one of the greats on your way to the park and arrive with a full stomach. You will not regret it.</p>
          <p>For the best fountain views, sit behind home plate or along the first-base side. The 322-foot fountain complex stretches across the outfield beyond right-center field, and from these angles you get the full panoramic effect -- especially at night when the water is illuminated. It is one of the best views in baseball.</p>
          <p>Royals fans are some of the warmest and friendliest in the Midwest. Kansas City is a genuine, welcoming city, and the people at Kauffman Stadium reflect that. Do not be surprised if the fans around you strike up a conversation, share tips on where to eat, or simply make you feel at home. Visiting fans consistently describe Kauffman as one of the most pleasant experiences in the American League.</p>

        <div class="drawback-box">
          <p class="drawback-box__label">Worth Knowing</p>
          <p>The biggest drawback of Kauffman Stadium is its location. The Truman Sports Complex sits in a suburban area surrounded by parking lots and highways. There is no walkable neighborhood, no cluster of bars and restaurants, no urban energy outside the gates. When the game ends, you walk to your car in a sea of asphalt and drive away. It is the opposite of the integrated, downtown ballpark experience that newer stadiums offer.</p>
          <p>There is no public transit to Kauffman Stadium. No light rail, no subway, no convenient bus service. If you do not have a car or a rideshare app, getting to the game is a genuine challenge. For a city that dreams of a vibrant game-day atmosphere, the lack of transit connectivity is a real limitation.</p>
          <p>Summers in Kansas City are hot and humid. July and August games can be oppressive, with temperatures in the 90s and humidity that makes it feel even worse. The open bowl design of Kauffman offers limited shade in most seating areas. Sunscreen, water, and evening games are your best friends during the peak of summer.</p>
          <p>A new downtown stadium has been proposed for the Royals, and if it moves forward, Kauffman Stadium's days as a major league venue may be numbered. The future is uncertain, but the possibility looms. If you want to experience the fountains and the crown scoreboard at the original Kauffman Stadium, the time to visit may be now.</p>
