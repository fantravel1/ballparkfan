The ballpark sits on the southern edge of the downtown core, and most downtown hotels are within a 10 to 15 minute walk of the gates. East 4th Street, one of Cleveland's best dining and entertainment districts, is just two blocks away. If you are coming from further out, the RTA Rapid Transit delivers you to Tower City Center, which is roughly a 10 minute walk to the park through the heart of downtown. Progressive Field's location is one of its biggest strengths."

        <!-- What Makes Progressive Field Special -->
        <div class="content-block" id="park-heading">
          <h2>What Makes Progressive Field Special</h2>
          <p>Progressive Field opened in 1994 as Jacobs Field and immediately became one of the defining ballparks of the retro-era wave that changed how America builds stadiums. While Camden Yards in Baltimore gets the credit for starting the movement, Progressive Field perfected many of its ideas -- an asymmetric outfield, exposed steel structure painted white against the sky, and an urban setting that makes the city itself part of the experience.</p>
          <p>The sight lines are among the best in baseball. At 34,830 seats, it is one of the smaller parks in the majors, and that intimacy is what makes it work. The upper deck hangs close to the field rather than being pushed back by luxury suites. You feel the game here in a way that bigger stadiums simply cannot replicate. There is not a bad seat in the house.</p>
          <p>Beyond the left field fence, the Cleveland skyline rises into view -- the Terminal Tower, Key Tower, and the cluster of downtown buildings creating a backdrop that connects the park to the city in every direction. The exposed steel trusses and open concourses give the park an honest, industrial character that feels perfectly at home in Cleveland.</p>
          <p>This is the park where the Cleveland franchise sold out 455 consecutive games from 1995 to 2001, a major league record that still stands. It is where the 2017 team won 22 games in a row, the longest winning streak in American League history. And it is where the franchise recently embraced its new identity as the Guardians, named after the Art Deco guardian statues on the nearby Hope Memorial Bridge -- a name rooted in the city itself.</p>
          <p>Progressive Field does not try to be flashy. It is a ballpark that respects its city, respects the game, and rewards the fans who show up.</p>

        <!-- Local Travel & Nearby Attractions -->
        <div class="content-block">
          <h2>Local Travel &amp; Nearby Attractions</h2>
          <p>Cleveland is one of baseball's most underrated destination cities, and Progressive Field sits right in the middle of its best attractions. Here are the spots worth building your trip around.</p>

          <div class="travel-card">
            <h3 class="travel-card__title">Rock and Roll Hall of Fame</h3>
            <p class="travel-card__distance">0.5 miles</p>
            <p class="travel-card__desc">The iconic I.M. Pei-designed building sits right on the shore of Lake Erie and is the single biggest reason people visit Cleveland outside of sports. The collection spans the entire history of rock and roll with interactive exhibits, original instruments, handwritten lyrics, and concert footage. Plan at least three hours, and do not skip the top-floor main hall. It is a world-class museum in every sense.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="travel-card">
            <h3 class="travel-card__title">West Side Market</h3>
            <p class="travel-card__distance">2 miles</p>
            <p class="travel-card__desc">Cleveland's historic 1912 indoor market is one of the oldest continuously operating public markets in America. More than 100 vendors sell everything from pierogies and fresh sausages to imported cheeses and Middle Eastern pastries under a stunning vaulted ceiling. The architecture alone is worth the trip, and the ethnic food stalls reflect Cleveland's rich immigrant history. Go hungry.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="travel-card">
            <h3 class="travel-card__title">Playhouse Square</h3>
            <p class="travel-card__distance">0.3 miles</p>
            <p class="travel-card__desc">The second-largest performing arts center in the United States, trailing only Lincoln Center. The restored theaters are stunning, and the outdoor GE Chandelier -- the world's largest outdoor chandelier -- illuminates the theater district at night. Even if you do not catch a show, the neighborhood is worth a walk for the architecture and the pre-game dining options.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="travel-card">
            <h3 class="travel-card__title">Great Lakes Science Center</h3>
            <p class="travel-card__distance">0.5 miles</p>
            <p class="travel-card__desc">Home to the NASA Glenn Visitor Center, this lakefront museum features hands-on science exhibits, a domed IMAX theater, and the historic steamship William G. Mather docked right outside. It is a great stop for families, and the lakefront location next to the Rock Hall makes it easy to combine both in a single day on the waterfront.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="travel-card">
            <h3 class="travel-card__title">East 4th Street</h3>
            <p class="travel-card__distance">0.2 miles</p>
            <p class="travel-card__desc">Cleveland's premier pedestrian-friendly dining and entertainment district is just two blocks from Progressive Field. The cobblestone street is lined with restaurants, bars, and live music venues, including restaurants from celebrity chef Michael Symon. It is the best pre-game and post-game destination in the city, buzzing with energy on game nights and weekend evenings alike.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <!-- Getting There -->
        <div class="content-block">
          <h2>Getting There</h2>
          <h3>RTA Rapid Transit</h3>
          <p>Cleveland's RTA Rapid Transit system is the easiest way to reach Progressive Field without a car. The Red Line runs from Cleveland Hopkins International Airport to Tower City Center downtown, and from there the park is roughly a 10 minute walk east through the Gateway District. The Blue and Green Lines also serve Tower City. Fares are affordable and service runs frequently on game days.</p>

          <h3>Walking from Downtown</h3>
          <p>Progressive Field sits on the southern edge of downtown Cleveland, and it is an easy walk from virtually any downtown hotel. East 4th Street, Euclid Avenue, and Ontario Street all lead directly to the park. Most fans find themselves at the gates within 10 to 15 minutes from anywhere in the downtown core, passing restaurants and bars the entire way.</p>

          <h3>Driving &amp; Parking</h3>
          <p>Multiple parking garages surround Progressive Field in the Gateway District. Expect to pay $10 to $25 on game days depending on proximity and demand. The garages along East 9th Street and Ontario Street are the most convenient. For cheaper options, park a few blocks further out in downtown garages and walk. Street parking is limited on game nights, so garages are the safer bet.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Fan Tips -->
        <div class="content-block">
          <h2>Fan Tips</h2>
          <div class="tip-box">
            <p class="tip-box__label">Insider Tips</p>
            <p>Sit in the bleachers for the best atmosphere in the park -- the left field bleacher section is where the most passionate fans gather, and the energy is noticeably different from the rest of the stadium. Melt Bar and Grilled has a location inside Progressive Field and serves the enormous, creative grilled cheese sandwiches the restaurant is famous for across Cleveland. Do not miss it. And if you can time your visit to a Slider dollar dog night, do it -- one-dollar hot dogs are one of baseball's last great bargains and a genuine Cleveland tradition that packs the park.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <!-- Honest Drawbacks -->
        <div class="content-block">
          <h2>Honest Drawbacks</h2>
          <div class="drawback-box">
            <p class="drawback-box__label">Worth Knowing</p>
            <p>Lake Erie wind can be brutal at Progressive Field, especially in April, May, and September. The park sits close enough to the lake that cold gusts whip through the open concourses, so bring layers for early-season and late-season games even if the forecast looks mild. Attendance has struggled in recent years, and while that means cheap tickets are easy to find, it also means some weeknight games can feel sparsely attended and quiet. The area immediately around the park in the Gateway District can feel empty on non-game nights -- it is more of a sports and event zone than a vibrant neighborhood, so plan to head to East 4th Street or Ohio City for post-game energy.</p>
