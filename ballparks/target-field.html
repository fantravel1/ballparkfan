        <!-- What Makes Target Field Special -->
        <div class="content-block">
          <h2>What Makes Target Field Special</h2>
          <p>Target Field gave Minnesota something it had not had since 1981: outdoor professional baseball. For nearly three decades, the Twins played inside the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome, a cavernous inflatable-roof dome that had all the charm of an airplane hangar. When Target Field opened on April 12, 2010, it was not just a new stadium — it was a declaration that Minneapolis was willing to embrace its climate, cold and all, for the sake of the way baseball is supposed to feel. The crack of the bat under an open sky, the smell of fresh-cut grass, the sunset bleeding orange over the downtown skyline beyond the outfield — none of that existed inside the Metrodome. Target Field brought it all back.</p>
          <p>The ballpark itself is a handsome piece of architecture that feels unmistakably Minnesotan. The exterior is clad in local Kasota limestone and features native prairie grasses and wildflowers planted throughout the grounds, tying the structure to the landscape of the upper Midwest. The Minneapolis skyline rises dramatically beyond the outfield walls, giving the park one of the most striking urban backdrops in all of baseball. On a warm summer evening, the views from the upper deck are genuinely spectacular — the IDS Tower, the Capella Tower, and the rest of the Minneapolis skyline glowing against a darkening sky while baseball unfolds below.</p>
          <p>Outside the main gates, Target Plaza serves as the ballpark's gathering place, anchored by bronze statues of Twins legends including Harmon Killebrew, Rod Carew, Tony Oliva, and Kirby Puckett. The plaza is a destination before and after games, with live music, food vendors, and a sense of community that extends well beyond the stadium walls. Inside, the concession program leans heavily into local culture — Kramarczuk's sausages from the iconic Nordeast deli, walleye fingers, cheese curds, and an outstanding craft beer selection featuring Minnesota breweries like Summit, Surly, and Indeed. Beyond the right field stands, the iconic Minnie and Paul sign — a neon celebration featuring the two mascot characters shaking hands across the Mississippi River — lights up with every Twins home run, a beloved tradition that connects the modern park to the franchise's history.</p>

            <p class="travel-card__distance">1 mile away &middot; Art &amp; Culture</p>
            <p class="travel-card__desc">One of the largest urban sculpture parks in the country, the Minneapolis Sculpture Garden is home to the iconic Spoonbridge and Cherry, a 50-foot-long spoon balancing a bright red cherry that has become the unofficial symbol of Minneapolis. The free outdoor garden features dozens of large-scale works spread across 11 acres. Adjacent to it is the Walker Art Center, one of the most respected contemporary art museums in the United States, with world-class rotating exhibitions, film screenings, and performances. Together, they make for an ideal afternoon before a night game.</p>

            <p class="travel-card__distance">0.5 miles away &middot; History &amp; Architecture</p>
            <p class="travel-card__desc">Built inside the ruins of the Washburn A Mill, once the largest flour mill in the world, the Mill City Museum tells the story of Minneapolis's rise as the flour milling capital of America and its deep connection to the Mississippi River. The museum is an architectural marvel in its own right — the original limestone walls of the ruined mill have been preserved and incorporated into the modern building, creating a dramatic fusion of old and new. An eight-story elevator ride takes you through the mill's history floor by floor. Afterward, walk across the street to Gold Medal Park, a small green space with a spiral mound offering views of the river and the Stone Arch Bridge.</p>

          <div class="travel-card">
            <h3 class="travel-card__title">Chain of Lakes</h3>
            <p class="travel-card__distance">4 miles away &middot; Outdoor Recreation</p>
            <p class="travel-card__desc">Minneapolis is the City of Lakes, and the Chain of Lakes is the crown jewel of its park system. Lake Calhoun (Bde Maka Ska), Lake Harriet, Lake of the Isles, and Cedar Lake are connected by miles of paved bike paths and walking trails that wind through some of the most beautiful urban parkland in America. Rent a bike or kayak, go paddleboarding, swim at the public beaches, or simply walk the shoreline trails and watch the sailboats. On a summer afternoon before a Twins game, there is no better way to experience what makes Minneapolis special.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="travel-card">
            <h3 class="travel-card__title">First Avenue</h3>
            <p class="travel-card__distance">0.5 miles away &middot; Live Music</p>
            <p class="travel-card__desc">First Avenue is one of the most legendary music venues in America, immortalized in Prince's 1984 film Purple Rain. The building's exterior is covered in silver and gold stars bearing the names of artists who have performed there, from Prince and H&uuml;sker D&uuml; to Lizzo and Atmosphere. The club continues to host live shows nearly every night, spanning every genre from hip-hop to punk to electronic. If there is a show on an off-day or before a late game, it is an essential Minneapolis experience. Prince's spirit is everywhere in this city, and First Avenue is where it all started.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="travel-card">
            <h3 class="travel-card__title">Stone Arch Bridge</h3>
            <p class="travel-card__distance">0.8 miles away &middot; Landmark &amp; Views</p>
            <p class="travel-card__desc">The Stone Arch Bridge is a former railroad bridge that spans the Mississippi River just below St. Anthony Falls, the only natural waterfall on the entire Mississippi. Built in 1883 by railroad baron James J. Hill, the graceful limestone arch bridge is now a pedestrian and bicycle walkway offering some of the best views in the city — the falls, the downtown skyline, the milling district ruins, and the river stretching into the distance. It is one of the most photographed spots in Minneapolis and an easy walk from Target Field, especially when combined with a visit to the Mill City Museum.</p>

        <!-- Getting There -->
        <div class="content-block">
          <h2>Getting There</h2>
          <h3>Metro Blue &amp; Green Line Light Rail</h3>
          <p>Target Field has one of the best public transit connections of any ballpark in Major League Baseball. The Metro Blue Line and Green Line light rail both stop at Target Field station, which is directly adjacent to the ballpark — you step off the train and the stadium gates are right in front of you. The Blue Line connects to the Mall of America and Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport, making it incredibly convenient for visitors flying in. The Green Line runs between downtown Minneapolis and downtown St. Paul, connecting the two cities along University Avenue. On game days, Metro Transit runs additional service to handle the crowds, and the ride from any downtown Minneapolis hotel is typically under five minutes.</p>
          <h3>Bike Trails</h3>
          <p>Minneapolis is one of the most bike-friendly cities in America, and Target Field is easily accessible by bicycle. The Cedar Lake Trail runs directly to the ballpark from the western suburbs, and the Midtown Greenway connects from the south. Bike racks are available near the stadium entrances, and the Nice Ride bike-share program has stations scattered throughout downtown. Biking to a game on a warm summer evening is a quintessential Minneapolis experience.</p>
          <h3>Walking from Downtown</h3>
          <p>Target Field sits on the western edge of downtown Minneapolis, making it an easy walk from most downtown hotels, restaurants, and bars. The Warehouse District, with its converted loft buildings, breweries, and restaurants, is just a few blocks east of the park. The North Loop neighborhood, one of the trendiest areas in the city, is immediately adjacent. You can walk from virtually anywhere in downtown Minneapolis to the ballpark in 15 minutes or less.</p>

          <h2>Fan Tips</h2>
          <div class="tip-box">
            <p class="tip-box__label">Kramarczuk's Sausages Are the Signature Food</p>
            <p>Kramarczuk's has been a Minneapolis institution since 1954, serving East European-style sausages, bratwursts, and smoked meats out of their deli in the Nordeast neighborhood. Their stand at Target Field is the single most beloved food option in the park. The bratwurst with sauerkraut is the classic order, but the East European sausage with mustard is the insider pick. Lines get long by the third inning, so grab yours early. Pair it with a Surly Furious IPA from one of the craft beer stands for the definitive Target Field meal.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="tip-box">
            <p class="tip-box__label">Bring Layers — Weather Changes Fast</p>
            <p>Minnesota weather is famously unpredictable, and Target Field is fully exposed to the elements. A sunny 75-degree afternoon can give way to a cool, breezy 55-degree evening by the seventh inning stretch. Even in the heart of summer, bring a light jacket or hoodie for night games. In April, May, and September, come prepared for genuine cold — a warm base layer, a fleece, and a windbreaker are not overkill. The park has heated concourse floors to warm your feet, but the seats are in the open air and wind can whip through the bowl.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="tip-box">
            <p class="tip-box__label">Sit on the Third-Base Side for Skyline Views</p>
            <p>The Minneapolis skyline rises beyond the outfield and down the right field line, and the best views of it come from the third-base side of the park. Sections along the third-base line in the lower and upper decks give you a panoramic view of the downtown towers framed against the sky, especially stunning during sunset on a summer evening game. If you are choosing seats and the skyline matters to you, aim for the third-base side, anywhere from behind home plate to the left field corner.</p>

        <!-- Honest Drawbacks -->
        <div class="content-block">
          <h2>Honest Drawbacks</h2>
          <div class="drawback-box">
            <p class="drawback-box__label">Cold Early and Late Season Games</p>
            <p>This is the big one. Target Field is a beautiful outdoor ballpark, but Minneapolis is one of the coldest major cities in America, and the baseball season stretches into months when the weather simply does not cooperate. April games can see temperatures in the 30s, with wind chill making it feel even colder. It has snowed on Opening Day. September and October playoff games can be equally brutal, with fans bundled in winter coats and blankets. The Twins committed to outdoor baseball knowing this, and the park handles it as well as it can with heated floors and sheltered concourses, but there is no getting around the fact that some games are endurance tests rather than leisure activities.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="drawback-box">
            <p class="drawback-box__label">Short Baseball Season</p>
            <p>The flip side of the cold-weather problem is that the window of truly comfortable baseball at Target Field is narrow. The ideal months are June, July, and August, when warm temperatures and long summer evenings make the park shine. That gives you roughly three months of reliably pleasant conditions out of a six-month season. May can be hit or miss, April is often miserable, and September starts to turn. If you are planning a trip specifically to visit Target Field, aim for a summer game — the experience is dramatically better than an early-season or late-season visit.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="drawback-box">
            <p class="drawback-box__label">Inconsistent Playoff Success</p>
            <p>The Minnesota Twins have a passionate and loyal fanbase, but the franchise has struggled to sustain consistent postseason success in the modern era. The team has endured extended playoff losing streaks and periods of rebuilding that can dampen the atmosphere at the ballpark. When the Twins are competitive, Target Field is electric — the 2019 squad drew huge crowds and the energy was outstanding. But in down years, the combination of a cold-weather market and a struggling team can lead to quieter, less-full stadiums, especially on weeknight games in the shoulder months. The talent is often there, but sustained October baseball has been elusive.</p>
