      <!-- What Makes Guaranteed Rate Field Special -->
      <section class="content-block" aria-labelledby="what-makes-special">
        <h2 id="what-makes-special">What Makes Guaranteed Rate Field Special</h2>
        <p>Guaranteed Rate Field does not get the love it deserves. Overshadowed by its famous North Side rival, the White Sox home on 35th Street is an honest, no-frills ballpark with a character all its own. It is a South Side Chicago place through and through: unpretentious, proud, and fiercely loyal to its people. If Wrigley Field is the postcard, Guaranteed Rate Field is the conversation you have with the guy sitting next to you who has been coming here since the old Comiskey Park days.</p>

        <h3>South Side Chicago Character</h3>
        <p>The South Side is a different Chicago than the one tourists usually see. It is a patchwork of tight-knit neighborhoods built on generations of immigrant families, industrial grit, and deep civic pride. That identity is embedded in Guaranteed Rate Field. The fans here are not casual observers. They are people who grew up watching White Sox baseball with their parents and grandparents, who remember the old ballpark across the street, and who show up because this is their team and their neighborhood. That authenticity is something you cannot manufacture, and it makes every game feel personal.</p>

        <h3>Chicago Skyline Views</h3>
        <p>One of the genuine surprises of Guaranteed Rate Field is the view. From the upper deck and several vantage points throughout the park, the Chicago skyline rises dramatically to the north, with the Willis Tower and the downtown skyscrapers framing the outfield. On a clear evening, especially at sunset, the skyline views from this ballpark are among the best in baseball. It is a visual that rewards the fans who climb to the upper levels.</p>

        <h3>The Best Ballpark Food in Chicago</h3>
        <p>Between Chicago's two MLB parks, Guaranteed Rate Field wins the food competition and it is not particularly close. The concession offerings here reflect the multicultural South Side: elotes (Mexican street corn) that are legitimately outstanding, Polish sausages that have been a staple for decades, Chicago-style hot dogs done right, and Italian beef sandwiches dripping with giardiniera. The park has also embraced partnerships with local restaurants, bringing in rotating options that keep the food scene fresh. If you are a ballpark food fan, this is one of the best parks in the country.</p>

        <h3>The Exploding Scoreboard</h3>
        <p>The original exploding scoreboard was one of Bill Veeck's great inventions at old Comiskey Park, shooting off pinwheels and fireworks after every White Sox home run. The tradition carried over to the new park. When a White Sox player goes deep, the scoreboard beyond center field erupts with pyrotechnics, flashing lights, and the signature pinwheel spinning. It is loud, it is flashy, and it is one of baseball's great home run celebrations. The exploding scoreboard is as much a part of White Sox identity as the team itself.</p>

        <h3>Blue-Collar Baseball Atmosphere</h3>
        <p>There is no pretense at Guaranteed Rate Field. This is not a see-and-be-seen ballpark. It is a place where people come to watch baseball, eat good food, have a beer, and cheer for their team. The crowd skews working class and family-oriented. Conversations with strangers happen easily. The energy is warm and welcoming, especially to visiting fans who show genuine respect for the game. South Side fans have an underdog mentality forged by decades of playing second fiddle in their own city, and that chip on their shoulder makes the atmosphere feel more real than at most parks in baseball.</p>

        <h3>The Minnie Mi&ntilde;oso Statue</h3>
        <p>Outside the ballpark stands a statue of Saturnino Orestes Armas Mi&ntilde;oso, known as Minnie Mi&ntilde;oso, the "Cuban Comet." Mi&ntilde;oso broke the color barrier for the White Sox in 1951 and became one of the most beloved players in franchise history. His statue is a fitting tribute to a man who represented joy, resilience, and the multicultural spirit of the South Side. It is worth a moment of your time before you walk through the gates.</p>

        <h2 id="nearby-attractions">Local Travel</h2>
        <p>Guaranteed Rate Field sits in a part of Chicago that most tourists never explore, and that is their loss. The South Side neighborhoods surrounding the park are rich with culture, incredible food, and a sense of authenticity that the downtown tourist corridor cannot match.</p>

        <div class="travel-card">
          <h3 class="travel-card__title">Chinatown</h3>
          <p class="travel-card__distance">1 mile north</p>
          <p class="travel-card__desc">Chicago's Chinatown is one of the largest and most vibrant in North America, and it is just a short walk or one CTA stop from the ballpark. Wentworth Avenue is lined with dim sum houses, bakeries, herbal shops, and gift stores. Chinatown Square is a modern outdoor mall with dozens of restaurants. Come hungry: the dim sum at places like MingHin or Phoenix is world-class, and the bakeries sell pineapple buns and egg tarts for pocket change. It is the perfect pre-game or post-game destination and one of the best kept secrets of a White Sox trip.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="travel-card">
          <h3 class="travel-card__title">Pilsen</h3>
          <p class="travel-card__distance">2 miles west</p>
          <p class="travel-card__desc">Pilsen is the Mexican-American cultural heart of Chicago and one of the most visually stunning neighborhoods in the city. 18th Street is lined with murals, taquerias, panaderias, and galleries. The National Museum of Mexican Art is free and houses an extraordinary collection spanning 3,000 years of Mexican and Latino art. The tacos here are among the best in the country, full stop. Walk the streets slowly, look at the murals, and eat everything you can. Pilsen is an essential Chicago experience.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="travel-card">
          <h3 class="travel-card__title">Museum of Science and Industry</h3>
          <p class="travel-card__distance">5 miles south</p>
          <p class="travel-card__desc">The Museum of Science and Industry is the largest science museum in the Western Hemisphere, housed in the last remaining building from the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition. The permanent exhibits include a captured German U-505 submarine from World War II, a full-scale coal mine tour that takes you underground, and a mirror maze that kids and adults alike find mesmerizing. You could easily spend an entire day here. It sits on the lakefront in Jackson Park, near the University of Chicago campus, and is accessible via the Metra Electric line or CTA bus.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="travel-card">
          <h3 class="travel-card__title">Bridgeport Neighborhood</h3>
          <p class="travel-card__distance">Adjacent</p>
          <p class="travel-card__desc">Bridgeport is the neighborhood directly west of the ballpark and one of Chicago's oldest and most storied communities. This is old-school Chicago: a working-class neighborhood that produced five Chicago mayors, including Richard J. Daley and Richard M. Daley. Maria's Packaged Goods &amp; Community Bar is a nationally recognized cocktail bar hidden inside a former liquor store. The local bars and taverns along Halsted Street are unpretentious and welcoming. Bridgeport is White Sox territory through and through, and spending time here before or after a game gives you a taste of the real Chicago.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="travel-card">
          <h3 class="travel-card__title">Illinois Institute of Technology / Mies van der Rohe Campus</h3>
          <p class="travel-card__distance">1 mile south</p>
          <p class="travel-card__desc">Architecture fans should not miss the Illinois Institute of Technology campus, a masterpiece of modernist design by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe. Crown Hall, the architecture school building, is a National Historic Landmark and one of the most important buildings of the 20th century: a single open room enclosed in glass and steel that embodies Mies's "less is more" philosophy. The entire campus is a walking tour of mid-century modernism and is free to explore. It is a short walk south from the ballpark along State Street.</p>

      <!-- Getting There -->
      <section class="content-block" aria-labelledby="getting-there">
        <h2 id="getting-there">Getting There</h2>
        <p>Guaranteed Rate Field is well served by public transit. The CTA Red Line stops at Sox-35th, which puts you steps from the main gates. It is the easiest and fastest way to get to the park from downtown or anywhere along the Red Line corridor. The station gets a heavy police presence on game days and the walk from the platform to the ballpark is short and straightforward.</p>
        <p>The CTA Green Line also has a stop at 35th-Bronzeville-IIT, about a 10-minute walk east of the stadium. The Metra Rock Island line stops at 35th Street as well, which is useful if you are coming from the south suburbs.</p>
        <p>If you are driving, Guaranteed Rate Field has something Wrigley Field does not: parking. Multiple large lots surround the stadium, and parking is relatively affordable by major league standards. The lots fill up closer to game time but rarely sell out entirely given recent attendance levels. Street parking in the surrounding neighborhood is limited but possible on non-event days. For most visitors, the Red Line remains the best option.</p>

        <div class="tip-box">
          <p class="tip-box__label">Insider Tips</p>
          <p>Eat the elotes. Mexican street corn is the signature food at Guaranteed Rate Field, and it is legitimately one of the best concession items at any ballpark in America. Grilled corn on the cob coated with mayo, cotija cheese, chili powder, and a squeeze of lime. The Polish sausage is the other must-have: a South Side Chicago tradition that predates the current stadium.</p>
          <p>Sit in the upper deck for the skyline views. The lower bowl is closer to the action, but the upper deck gives you a panoramic view of the Chicago skyline beyond the outfield that is genuinely spectacular, especially during sunset games. Section 524 through 532 offer some of the best angles.</p>
          <p>South Side fans are passionate and welcoming. Do not believe the stereotypes. White Sox fans are some of the most knowledgeable and hospitable in baseball. Show up, be respectful, ask about the team, and you will make friends. They love their ballpark and they love talking about it with anyone who cares enough to visit.</p>

      <!-- Honest Drawbacks -->

        <h2 id="honest-drawbacks">Honest Drawbacks</h2>
        <div class="drawback-box">
          <p class="drawback-box__label">Worth Knowing</p>
          <p>The stadium design is bland. Guaranteed Rate Field opened in 1991, just before the retro ballpark revolution that Camden Yards launched in 1992. It was built in the cookie-cutter era's final gasp: symmetrical, concrete, and architecturally uninspired. Renovations over the years have softened the edges and improved the fan experience, but the bones of the building remain plain compared to the beautiful parks that followed it. It is functional, not beautiful.</p>
          <p>The neighborhood can feel isolated at night. The area immediately surrounding the ballpark is not a bustling entertainment district. After the game, the streets thin out quickly, and the walk to the CTA station or parking lots can feel quiet and empty. Stick with the crowd, move with purpose, and you will be fine, but it is not the kind of neighborhood where you linger and explore after dark.</p>
          <p>The White Sox have struggled recently. On-field performance has been poor in recent seasons, which affects the energy in the building. The team has been rebuilding, and while that means cheap tickets and easy availability, it also means you may be watching a team that is not competitive. Check the schedule and the opponent if the quality of the game matters to you.</p>
          <p>Attendance has been low. Empty seats are common, especially on weeknights and during stretches of losing. A half-full stadium can feel cavernous and quiet. The flip side is that you can often upgrade your seats, spread out, and enjoy the park at your own pace, but do not expect the electric atmosphere of a sold-out crowd at most games.</p>
