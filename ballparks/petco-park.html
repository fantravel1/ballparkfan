        <!-- What Makes Petco Park Special -->
        <div class="content-block">
          <h2>What Makes Petco Park Special</h2>
          <p>Petco Park is one of those rare ballparks where everything just works. The weather in San Diego is essentially perfect for baseball — warm, dry evenings with a gentle marine breeze rolling in from the Pacific. You will never worry about a rain delay here. The climate alone makes this one of the most comfortable parks in the entire league, and it sets the tone for a relaxed, genuinely enjoyable experience from the first pitch to the last.</p>

          <h3>Gaslamp Quarter Location</h3>
          <p>The ballpark sits at the eastern edge of the Gaslamp Quarter, San Diego's famous 16-block historic district packed with restaurants, bars, and nightlife. Unlike so many modern stadiums stranded in parking-lot wastelands, Petco Park is deeply embedded in a walkable urban neighborhood. You can have dinner and drinks steps from the gates, then stroll to your seats without ever touching a steering wheel. The pre-game and post-game scene here is among the best in baseball.</p>

          <h3>Western Metal Supply Co. Building</h3>
          <p>One of the most distinctive architectural features in any ballpark in America: the four-story Western Metal Supply Co. building, a 1909 warehouse that was preserved and integrated directly into the left-field corner of the stadium. The foul pole is literally bolted to its corner. The upper floors house suites and a rooftop deck, while the ground floor contains the Padres Team Store. It is a brilliant piece of urban preservation that gives Petco Park a character and sense of place that no other modern park can replicate.</p>

          <h3>Park at the Park</h3>
          <p>Beyond center field, a 2.7-acre grassy hillside area called the Park at the Park offers one of the most unique game-day experiences in baseball. Fans spread out blankets, let kids run around, and watch the game from the grass for a fraction of the cost of a regular ticket. It feels more like a picnic than a sporting event, and that is exactly the point. A bronze statue of Padres legend Tony Gwynn stands here as well.</p>

          <h3>Craft Beer Capital</h3>
          <p>San Diego is one of the undisputed craft beer capitals of the United States, and Petco Park leans into that identity hard. Local breweries like AleSmith, Ballast Point, Stone Brewing, Modern Times, and Societe Brewing are represented throughout the concourses. The selection is deep, rotating, and genuinely excellent — a world apart from the generic macro-lager experience at most parks.</p>

          <h3>Open Concourses</h3>
          <p>The concourses at Petco Park are wide, airy, and open to the playing field, so you never feel boxed in or cut off from the action. You can grab a beer, browse the food options, and still watch the game as you walk. Combined with the San Diego evening air, the whole park feels breezy and spacious even on a sold-out night.</p>

        <!-- Getting There -->
        <div class="content-block">
          <h2>Getting There</h2>
          <p>Petco Park is one of the most accessible ballparks in the country. The San Diego Trolley Green Line stops at the Gaslamp Quarter station, which is roughly a two-block walk from the main gates. The trolley runs frequently on game days and connects to the broader MTS transit network, so getting in and out without a car is straightforward.</p>
          <p>If you are staying in a downtown San Diego hotel, chances are you can walk to the park in under 15 minutes. The Gaslamp Quarter, East Village, and Little Italy neighborhoods are all within easy walking distance.</p>
          <p>If you do drive, several parking structures surround the ballpark, including the Padres-operated Tailgate Lot and the 6th &amp; K Parkade. Expect to pay a premium on game days, and arrive early — traffic around the Gaslamp Quarter can get congested close to first pitch. Rideshare drop-off zones are well-marked along Harbor Drive and Park Boulevard.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Fan Tips -->
        <div class="content-block">
          <h2>Fan Tips</h2>
          <div class="tip-box">
            <p class="tip-box__label">Insider Tips</p>
            <p>Sit in the Park at the Park for a casual, picnic-style vibe — bring a blanket, grab food from the concourse, and stretch out on the grass beyond center field. It is one of the most relaxed ways to watch a game anywhere in baseball.</p>
            <p>The craft beer selection at Petco Park is among the best in all of MLB. Skip the big-name domestics and explore the local San Diego breweries on tap — you will not be disappointed.</p>
            <p>Do not leave without trying the fish tacos from Hodad's, a beloved San Diego institution with a stand inside the park. The Baja-style fish tacos here are the real deal.</p>
            <p>If you can, grab a seat with a view toward left field for sunset. As the sun drops behind the Western Metal Supply Co. building and the sky turns orange and pink, you will understand why people say Petco Park has the best atmosphere in the NL West.</p>

        <!-- Honest Drawbacks -->
        <div class="content-block">
          <h2>Honest Drawbacks</h2>
          <div class="drawback-box">
            <p class="drawback-box__label">Worth Knowing</p>
            <p>The sun can be absolutely brutal during day games, especially in the summer months. If you are attending an afternoon start, bring sunscreen, a hat, and plenty of water. This is Southern California, and the UV is no joke.</p>
            <p>Left-field seats bake in direct sunlight for much of the afternoon and early evening. If you are heat-sensitive, aim for seats on the third-base side or under the overhang for shade.</p>
            <p>San Diego's fan culture, while passionate, can be noticeably quieter than cities like St. Louis, Philadelphia, or Chicago. The laid-back SoCal vibe extends to the stands — do not expect a deafening roar on every strikeout. Some fans love the mellow energy; others wish for more intensity.</p>
