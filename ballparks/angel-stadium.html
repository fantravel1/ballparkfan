      <!-- What Makes Angel Stadium Special -->
      <section class="content-block" aria-labelledby="what-makes-special">
        <h2 id="what-makes-special">What Makes Angel Stadium Special</h2>
        <p>Angel Stadium is a survivor. Opened in 1966, it is the fourth-oldest ballpark in Major League Baseball, behind only Fenway Park, Wrigley Field, and Dodger Stadium. It has been renovated, enclosed, reopened, and reimagined across nearly six decades, and through all of it the park has retained a character and charm that newer stadiums spend hundreds of millions of dollars trying to manufacture. This is a ballpark that has earned its identity the old-fashioned way -- through time.</p>

        <h3>The Big A and the Halo</h3>
        <p>The Big A is a 230-foot-tall A-frame structure topped with a halo, and it is the most iconic symbol of the Angels franchise. Originally built as the stadium's main scoreboard support in 1966, it towered beyond the outfield fence and was visible for miles across the flat expanse of Orange County. When the stadium was enclosed for football in 1979, the Big A was relocated to the parking lot near the main entrance, where it has stood ever since as a landmark and a beacon. The halo at the top of the structure lights up after every Angels home victory. Fans leaving the stadium look up to see if it is glowing -- a tradition so deeply embedded in Angels culture that "light up the halo" has become the unofficial rallying cry of the franchise. On a warm Anaheim night, seeing that halo lit against the Southern California sky is one of the quiet, perfect moments in baseball.</p>

        <h3>The Rock Pile, Waterfall, and Geysers</h3>
        <p>In center field, a massive artificial rock formation rises behind the outfield fence, complete with a cascading waterfall, erupting geysers, and live vegetation. The rock pile was added during the stadium's 1998 renovation, when the football enclosure was removed and the park was restored to a baseball-only configuration. When an Angel hits a home run or the team wins, the geysers shoot water high into the air while the waterfall thunders down the rocks. It is dramatic, theatrical, and unmistakably Californian. The rock pile has become one of the most photographed features of any ballpark in baseball, and the pyrotechnics that accompany it on fireworks nights turn center field into a spectacle that rivals anything in the sport.</p>

        <h3>One of the Oldest Parks in MLB</h3>
        <p>There is something special about watching baseball in a stadium that has hosted games since the mid-1960s. Angel Stadium has seen Nolan Ryan throw two of his record seven no-hitters here. It hosted the 2002 World Series, when the Angels -- perennial underdogs in their own market -- rallied from a 3-2 series deficit against the San Francisco Giants to win the franchise's only championship in one of the most dramatic Fall Classics in modern memory. The Rally Monkey became a national phenomenon during that postseason run, and the spirit of that unlikely championship still echoes through the stadium on big nights.</p>

        <h3>The Shohei Ohtani Era</h3>
        <p>For six seasons, Shohei Ohtani did things at Angel Stadium that no one had done in a century. He pitched and hit at an elite level simultaneously, drawing comparisons to Babe Ruth and creating moments that transcended the sport. Every Ohtani start was an event. Every at-bat carried the possibility of something historic. The energy in the stadium when he stepped to the plate or took the mound was electric in a way that Angel Stadium had rarely experienced. Ohtani has moved on, but the memories of what he accomplished here -- the two-way brilliance, the towering home runs, the 100-mph fastballs -- are woven into the fabric of this ballpark forever.</p>

        <h3>California Sunshine</h3>
        <p>Angel Stadium benefits from one of the best climates in professional sports. Anaheim averages more than 280 sunny days per year, and rain delays are extraordinarily rare. The open bowl design of the stadium lets the Southern California light flood the field, and on a clear evening the sunset paints the sky in shades of orange and pink beyond the outfield. There is a laid-back, easygoing quality to an Angels game that reflects the region itself -- warm air, blue skies, and the unhurried pace of a summer evening in Orange County.</p>

        <h2 id="nearby-attractions">Local Travel</h2>
        <p>Angel Stadium sits in the heart of Orange County, surrounded by world-famous attractions, beautiful coastline, and the kind of year-round sunshine that makes Southern California the envy of the baseball world. Build a full trip around your visit -- there is no shortage of things to do within a short drive of the ballpark.</p>

        <div class="travel-card">
          <h3 class="travel-card__title">Disneyland Resort</h3>
          <p class="travel-card__distance">1 mile</p>
          <p class="travel-card__desc">The original Disneyland theme park is less than a mile from Angel Stadium, making this one of the most remarkable pairings of a ballpark and a landmark attraction anywhere in sports. Walk or take a five-minute rideshare to the Happiest Place on Earth. The resort includes the original Disneyland Park, Disney California Adventure with its thrilling rides and stunning World of Color nighttime show, and the Downtown Disney shopping and dining district. It is entirely feasible to spend the day at the parks and catch an evening game, or grab dinner at Downtown Disney after the final out. For families, the Anaheim combination of Angels baseball and Disneyland is hard to beat.</p>

        <div class="travel-card">
          <h3 class="travel-card__title">Huntington Beach</h3>
          <p class="travel-card__distance">15 miles</p>
          <p class="travel-card__desc">Surf City USA. Huntington Beach is the iconic Southern California beach town, with a legendary pier stretching into the Pacific, world-class surfing, beach volleyball courts lining the sand, and some of the best sunsets on the West Coast. The vibe is pure California -- surfers in the water, bonfires on the beach, and a boardwalk scene that feels like it belongs in a movie. Main Street runs perpendicular to the pier and is lined with surf shops, taco stands, and bars. Head down before an afternoon game or after a night game and experience the Orange County coastline at its most quintessential.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="travel-card">
          <h3 class="travel-card__title">Knott's Berry Farm</h3>
          <p class="travel-card__distance">6 miles</p>
          <p class="travel-card__desc">The oldest theme park in California, predating even Disneyland. Knott's Berry Farm started as a roadside berry stand and fried chicken restaurant in the 1920s and grew into a full-fledged amusement park with world-class roller coasters, the historic Ghost Town with its Old West atmosphere, and the legendary boysenberry food that started it all. The boysenberry was actually created here, and the park leans into that heritage with boysenberry pie, boysenberry punch, boysenberry everything. It is less crowded and less expensive than Disneyland, with a more authentic, homegrown California feel. The roller coasters are genuinely excellent.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="travel-card">
          <h3 class="travel-card__title">Anaheim Packing District</h3>
          <p class="travel-card__distance">3 miles</p>
          <p class="travel-card__desc">A beautifully repurposed 1919 citrus packing house that has been transformed into one of Orange County's best food and drink destinations. The Anaheim Packing House is an artisan food hall with dozens of vendors serving everything from handmade empanadas and ramen to craft cocktails and small-batch ice cream. The industrial architecture has been preserved and enhanced, with exposed brick, soaring ceilings, and a warm, communal atmosphere. It is the perfect pre-game stop -- grab food from multiple vendors, find a seat on the upstairs balcony, and soak in the energy of one of Anaheim's most vibrant gathering places.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="travel-card">
          <h3 class="travel-card__title">Crystal Cove State Park</h3>
          <p class="travel-card__distance">20 miles</p>
          <p class="travel-card__desc">One of the most stunning stretches of coastline in Southern California. Crystal Cove State Park features 3.2 miles of pristine beach, tide pools teeming with marine life, coastal hiking trails through sage scrub and wildflowers, and a collection of historic beachside cottages from the 1930s and 1940s that have been preserved as a reminder of old California. The Crystal Cove Historic District feels like stepping back in time -- weathered wood cottages perched above the sand, with the Pacific stretching to the horizon. The hiking trails along the bluffs offer sweeping views of the OC coastline. Come for a morning hike or an afternoon on the beach before heading to the ballpark for an evening game.</p>

      <!-- Getting There -->
      <section class="content-block" aria-labelledby="getting-there">
        <h2 id="getting-there">Getting There</h2>
        <p>Angel Stadium sits just off the Interstate 5 and State Route 57 interchange in Anaheim, one of the most accessible freeway locations in Orange County. Getting to the stadium is straightforward. Getting there without sitting in traffic is another matter entirely.</p>

        <h3>ARTIC Transit Center</h3>
        <p>The Anaheim Regional Transportation Intermodal Center, known as ARTIC, is located directly adjacent to Angel Stadium and serves as a hub for Amtrak, Metrolink commuter rail, and local bus services. If you are coming from Los Angeles, San Diego, or anywhere along the Southern California rail corridor, ARTIC makes it possible to reach the ballpark without a car. The station is a striking, modern structure with a distinctive shell-shaped roof, and the walk from the platform to the stadium gates takes only a few minutes. Metrolink offers special service on game days, and the Pacific Surfliner Amtrak route stops here as well.</p>

        <h3>Driving and Parking</h3>
        <p>Angel Stadium is surrounded by large surface parking lots, and there is no shortage of spaces on a typical game night. Parking is available in the stadium-owned lots as well as nearby private lots. The convenience of the I-5 and SR-57 interchange means you can reach the stadium from almost anywhere in the greater Los Angeles and Orange County area, but the freeways themselves are the problem. Southern California freeway traffic is legendary for a reason, and the pre-game and post-game congestion on the I-5 through Anaheim can be brutal. Leave early, be patient, and expect the drive to take longer than the map says.</p>

        <h3>Rideshare</h3>
        <p>Uber and Lyft are widely used for Angels games, with designated pickup and dropoff zones near the stadium. Rideshare is a particularly good option if you are staying near the Disneyland Resort area, as the trip is short and avoids the hassle of parking. After the game, expect some wait time as the lots clear, but the rideshare experience at Angel Stadium is generally smoother than at many other California ballparks.</p>

        <div class="tip-box">
          <p class="tip-box__label">Insider Tips</p>
          <p>Catch a sunset over the outfield. Angel Stadium's open bowl design and west-facing upper deck give you a gorgeous view of the sky turning orange and pink as the game gets underway on a summer evening. It is one of the underrated pleasures of watching a game here.</p>
          <p>Sit in left field for the best view of the rock pile. The cascading waterfall, erupting geysers, and the full scale of the rock formation are most impressive from the left-field seats, where you can see the entire center-field feature head-on. When a home run triggers the geysers, you get the full show.</p>
          <p>Helmet nachos are the signature concession item at Angel Stadium. Served in a miniature batting helmet, loaded with chips, cheese, jalapenos, and your choice of toppings, they are messy, indulgent, and exactly what ballpark food should be. You keep the helmet as a souvenir.</p>
          <p>Angel Stadium is one of the most family-friendly parks in the American League. The atmosphere is relaxed, the crowd is welcoming, the stadium is easy to navigate, and the proximity to Disneyland means many families are already in vacation mode. Kids love the rock pile, the fireworks nights, and the Rally Monkey appearances on the video board.</p>

      <!-- Honest Drawbacks -->
      <section class="content-block" aria-labelledby="honest-drawbacks">
        <h2 id="honest-drawbacks">Honest Drawbacks</h2>
        <div class="drawback-box">
          <p class="drawback-box__label">Worth Knowing</p>
          <p>Angel Stadium is surrounded by parking lots. There is no walkable neighborhood, no cluster of bars and restaurants steps from the gates, no urban energy outside the stadium. When the game ends, you walk across asphalt to your car. The Anaheim Packing District is a few miles away and worth the trip, but the immediate surroundings of the ballpark offer nothing beyond the stadium itself. If you are coming from a ballpark like Oracle Park or Wrigley Field where the neighborhood is part of the experience, the contrast is stark.</p>
          <p>The stadium is in suburban Anaheim, not Los Angeles. Despite the team's name, Angel Stadium is in Orange County, roughly 30 miles southeast of downtown LA. The surrounding area is strip malls, hotels, and freeway interchanges. It is functional, not charming. The location works logistically but lacks the sense of place that defines the best ballpark experiences.</p>
          <p>Angel Stadium is showing its age. While renovations have kept the park functional and the rock pile gives it visual flair, the bones of the stadium are nearly sixty years old. The concourses can feel narrow and dated compared to modern ballparks, the seating bowl lacks some of the creature comforts fans expect in newer venues, and the overall infrastructure is a generation behind parks built in the 2000s and 2010s. It is still a perfectly enjoyable place to watch a game, but it does not compete with the newest stadiums on amenities and design.</p>
          <p>Freeway traffic is miserable. The I-5 through Anaheim is one of the most congested stretches of highway in Southern California, and game-day traffic compounds the problem. Getting to and from Angel Stadium during rush hour or after a weekend game can test your patience in ways that no other aspect of the experience will. Use ARTIC if you can. If you must drive, arrive early and leave late.</p>

Fans who want to experience the Big A, the rock pile, and the current configuration of Angel Stadium should plan a visit while the ballpark remains in its present form.</p>
