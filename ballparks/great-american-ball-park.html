      <!-- What Makes Great American Ball Park Special -->
      <section class="content-block" aria-labelledby="what-makes-special">
        <h2 id="what-makes-special">What Makes Great American Ball Park Special</h2>
        <p>Great American Ball Park is the home of baseball's oldest professional franchise, and that history seeps into every corner of the experience. The Cincinnati Reds have been playing professional baseball since 1881, longer than any other team in the sport. When you walk into Great American Ball Park, you are walking into a direct line of continuity that stretches back to the earliest days of the game itself.</p>
        <p>The setting is what elevates this park above the ordinary. Sitting directly on the north bank of the Ohio River, the stadium offers sweeping views of the water, the Roebling Suspension Bridge -- the 1866 engineering marvel that inspired the Brooklyn Bridge -- and the green hills of northern Kentucky rising beyond the opposite shore. On a clear summer evening, with the sun dropping behind the Kentucky skyline and the river reflecting the fading light, it is a genuinely beautiful place to watch a baseball game.</p>
        <p>The most distinctive feature at Great American Ball Park is impossible to miss. Two towering smokestacks, modeled after the paddle-wheel steamboats that once dominated the Ohio River, flank the batter's eye in center field. They are not decoration. Every time a Reds player hits a home run, the smokestacks erupt with flames and fireworks, sending pyrotechnics shooting into the night sky above the riverfront. It is one of the most dramatic home run celebrations in all of baseball, and the crowd roars every single time.</p>
        <p>Attached to the ballpark is the Cincinnati Reds Hall of Fame and Museum, one of the most comprehensive team museums in professional sports. The exhibits chronicle the full sweep of Reds history, from the Big Red Machine dynasty of the 1970s -- Johnny Bench, Joe Morgan, Pete Rose, Tony Perez -- through to the modern era. The Rose Garden, a tribute area near the main entrance, honors the all-time hits leader despite the complicated legacy that surrounds him. Cincinnati does not run from its history. It puts it on display.</p>
        <p>The riverfront setting ties everything together. The park sits in a stretch of Cincinnati's riverfront that has been revitalized over the past two decades, with The Banks development bringing restaurants, bars, and public green space right to the stadium's doorstep. You can walk from the ballpark across the Roebling Bridge to Covington, Kentucky, in ten minutes. You can watch riverboats pass on the Ohio from the outfield concourse. The river is not just a backdrop -- it is part of the experience.</p>

        <h2 id="nearby-attractions">Local Travel</h2>
        <p>Cincinnati is a two-state city straddling the Ohio River, and Great American Ball Park sits right in the middle of it. The best attractions are within walking distance, and half of them are technically in Kentucky.</p>

        <div class="travel-card">
          <h3 class="travel-card__title">Roebling Suspension Bridge</h3>
          <p class="travel-card__distance">0.2 miles</p>
          <p class="travel-card__desc">The John A. Roebling Suspension Bridge, completed in 1866, was the longest suspension bridge in the world when it opened and served as the prototype for the Brooklyn Bridge that Roebling would design next. Walk across it from the Cincinnati riverfront to Covington, Kentucky, in about ten minutes. The views of the river, the Cincinnati skyline, and Great American Ball Park from the bridge are stunning, especially at sunset. It is a National Historic Landmark and one of the most beautiful pedestrian walks in the Midwest.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="travel-card">
          <h3 class="travel-card__title">Cincinnati Reds Hall of Fame &amp; Museum</h3>
          <p class="travel-card__distance">Attached</p>
          <p class="travel-card__desc">One of the best team-specific museums in all of professional sports, built right into the western side of Great American Ball Park. The museum covers the complete history of the Cincinnati Reds, from the original Red Stockings through the Big Red Machine dynasty of the 1970s to the modern era. Pete Rose's hit record, Johnny Bench's catcher's gear, exhibits on the 1975 and 1976 World Series champions -- it is all here. Some game tickets include museum admission, so check before buying a separate ticket. Allow at least an hour.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="travel-card">
          <h3 class="travel-card__title">Findlay Market</h3>
          <p class="travel-card__distance">1.5 miles</p>
          <p class="travel-card__desc">Ohio's oldest continuously operated public market, open since 1855. Findlay Market is a covered, open-air market in the Over-the-Rhine neighborhood with local vendors selling produce, meats, cheeses, baked goods, flowers, and prepared foods. On weekends, the surrounding streets fill with additional outdoor vendors and craftspeople. It is the kind of authentic, lived-in market that most cities have lost. Grab breakfast or lunch here before heading to the ballpark -- the goetta (a Cincinnati-original sausage made with oats) is not to be missed.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="travel-card">
          <h3 class="travel-card__title">Over-the-Rhine</h3>
          <p class="travel-card__distance">1 mile</p>
          <p class="travel-card__desc">One of the most remarkable urban revitalization stories in America. Over-the-Rhine, or OTR, is a historic neighborhood just north of downtown Cincinnati filled with stunning 19th-century Italianate architecture -- the largest collection of its kind in the United States. Once deeply neglected, the neighborhood has been transformed over the past decade into a vibrant district of craft breweries, independent restaurants, boutique shops, and art galleries. Rhinegeist Brewery occupies a massive former bottling plant and is worth the visit alone. Cincinnati Music Hall, a National Historic Landmark, anchors the northern end of the neighborhood with its spectacular Gothic Revival facade.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="travel-card">
          <h3 class="travel-card__title">Newport Aquarium</h3>
          <p class="travel-card__distance">0.5 miles across the river</p>
          <p class="travel-card__desc">Walk across the river to Newport, Kentucky, and you will find one of the top aquariums in the Midwest. The Newport Aquarium features a seamless acrylic shark tunnel where sharks swim directly over and around you, interactive penguin encounters, and a massive collection of freshwater and saltwater exhibits. It is a short walk from Great American Ball Park via the Purple People Bridge or the Roebling Bridge, making it an easy pre-game activity, especially if you are traveling with kids.</p>

      <!-- Getting There -->
      <section class="content-block" aria-labelledby="getting-there">
        <h2 id="getting-there">Getting There</h2>
        <p>Great American Ball Park sits on the riverfront in downtown Cincinnati, easily accessible from multiple directions. Its central location is one of its biggest advantages -- unlike suburban stadiums, you can walk to this park from hotels, restaurants, and bars throughout downtown and even from northern Kentucky.</p>
        <p>If you are driving, Interstate 71 and Interstate 75 converge just north of the stadium, and both have exits that put you within blocks of the ballpark. Multiple parking garages line the riverfront and downtown streets, with prices typically ranging from $15 to $30 on game days depending on proximity. The garages along Second Street and at The Banks development are the most convenient. Arriving 45 minutes early will give you the best selection.</p>
        <p>Cincinnati's Metro bus system operates routes throughout the city with stops near the riverfront, and several routes run enhanced service on game days. For fans staying downtown, the walk to the park is straightforward -- the stadium is visible from most of downtown Cincinnati, and the walk from Fountain Square takes about 15 minutes.</p>
        <p>One of the unique aspects of getting to Great American Ball Park is that you can walk from Kentucky. Fans staying in Covington or Newport can cross the Roebling Suspension Bridge or the Purple People Bridge on foot and arrive at the ballpark in 10 to 15 minutes. It is a two-state ballpark experience that no other stadium in baseball can offer.</p>

        <div class="tip-box">
          <p class="tip-box__label">Insider Tips</p>
          <p>Skyline Chili is the polarizing local delicacy, and you absolutely have to try it. Cincinnati chili is nothing like Texas chili -- it is a thin, cinnamon-and-chocolate-spiced meat sauce served over spaghetti and buried under a mountain of shredded cheddar cheese. People either become obsessed with it or stare at their plate in confusion. Either way, it is an essential Cincinnati experience, and you can get it right inside the ballpark. Order a three-way (chili, spaghetti, cheese) and decide for yourself.</p>
          <p>For the best views in the house, sit along the first-base side. From there, you get the full panorama of the Ohio River, the Roebling Bridge, and the Kentucky hillside beyond the outfield. Evening games are especially beautiful when the sun sets behind you and the river catches the fading light.</p>
          <p>Check your game ticket carefully before buying a separate Reds Hall of Fame and Museum ticket. Some ticket packages include museum admission, and the museum is genuinely worth visiting -- it is one of the best team museums in baseball, with extensive exhibits on the Big Red Machine, Pete Rose, and the full history of baseball's oldest professional franchise.</p>

        <h2 id="honest-drawbacks">Honest Drawbacks</h2>
        <div class="drawback-box">
          <p class="drawback-box__label">Worth Knowing</p>
          <p>The stadium design, while functional and well-located, is somewhat generic. Great American Ball Park was part of the early-2000s wave of retro-style ballparks, and it does not have the architectural distinctiveness of PNC Park, Oracle Park, or Camden Yards. The smokestacks and riverfront setting give it personality, but the overall structure feels like it could belong to any team. It is a good ballpark, not a great one, in terms of pure design.</p>
          <p>The Reds have struggled competitively for much of the past two decades, which can mean thinner crowds and a quieter atmosphere on weeknight games against non-marquee opponents. Cincinnati is a passionate baseball city with deep roots, but the energy in the park is directly tied to how the team is performing, and lean years show up in the stands.</p>
          <p>The riverfront location, while scenic, means wind can be a factor. The Ohio River corridor funnels breezes through the open sections of the stadium, and early-season and late-season games can feel noticeably colder than the temperature might suggest. Dress in layers for April and September games.</p>
          <p>Parking around the ballpark, particularly in the closest garages and lots along the riverfront, gets expensive on game days. Budget $20 to $30 for convenient parking, or consider parking further from the stadium in downtown garages and walking the extra ten minutes.</p>
