        <!-- What Makes T-Mobile Park Special -->
        <div class="content-block">
          <h2>What Makes T-Mobile Park Special</h2>
          <p>T-Mobile Park solved a problem that had plagued Seattle baseball for decades: how do you play outdoor baseball in one of the rainiest cities in America? The answer was a retractable roof unlike any other in the sport. Rather than enclosing the stadium like a dome, the three-panel roof slides open to one side, keeping rain off the field and fans while leaving the stadium open to the air, the breeze off Puget Sound, and the city skyline beyond the outfield. It is not a dome — it is an umbrella. On a clear Seattle evening with the roof tucked away and the sun going down behind the Olympic Mountains, there are few prettier places to watch a ballgame.</p>
          <p>Then there is the food. T-Mobile Park is widely regarded as having the best concessions in the American League, and the garlic fries are the crown jewel. This is where the now-ubiquitous ballpark garlic fry was born — a heaping tray of crispy fries tossed in a mound of freshly chopped garlic and parsley. You can smell them from three sections away, and they are worth every bit of the garlic breath that follows. Beyond the fries, the park offers Ivar's clam chowder in a bread bowl, sushi, wood-fired pizza, and a rotating lineup of Pacific Northwest craft beers that reflects Seattle's world-class food culture.</p>
          <p>The ballpark itself is an industrial-chic beauty. Exposed steel trusses, brick, and ironwork pay tribute to the warehouses and rail yards of the SoDo district it sits in. Real grass grows under the retractable roof — one of only a handful of covered stadiums in the world to maintain a natural playing surface. Down the left field concourse, the Edgar Martinez's Double corridor commemorates one of the most important moments in franchise history: Edgar's 1995 ALDS double that drove in the winning runs and saved baseball in Seattle. Ichiro Suzuki's legacy is everywhere, too — a tribute to the man who brought an international flair to the franchise and electrified the city during his record-breaking 2001 season and beyond. T-Mobile Park may not have a century of history, but it has soul, and it has arguably the most comfortable fan experience of any ballpark in the Pacific Northwest.</p>

          <div class="travel-card">
            <h3 class="travel-card__title">Pike Place Market</h3>
            <p class="travel-card__distance">1.5 miles away &middot; Iconic Market</p>
            <p class="travel-card__desc">Seattle's beating heart since 1907, Pike Place Market is one of the oldest continuously operated farmers markets in the United States. Watch the fishmongers hurl salmon through the air, visit the original Starbucks store, rub the snout of Rachel the Pig bronze statue for good luck, and browse stalls filled with artisan crafts, fresh flowers, and local produce. The market is a must-visit on any Seattle trip and pairs perfectly with a game-day afternoon.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="travel-card">
            <h3 class="travel-card__title">Pioneer Square</h3>
            <p class="travel-card__distance">0.5 miles away &middot; Historic District</p>
            <p class="travel-card__desc">Seattle's oldest neighborhood is a short walk north of the ballpark. The area is defined by restored Romanesque Revival brick buildings, art galleries, independent bookshops, and Occidental Park with its totem poles. Take the Underground Tour to explore the buried storefronts beneath the streets — remnants of the city that existed before the Great Seattle Fire of 1889 prompted the rebuilding of the neighborhood at a higher grade.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="travel-card">
            <h3 class="travel-card__title">Museum of Pop Culture (MoPOP)</h3>
            <p class="travel-card__distance">3 miles away &middot; Music &amp; Sci-Fi</p>
            <p class="travel-card__desc">Designed by Frank Gehry, the Museum of Pop Culture is a shimmering, wildly shaped building at the base of the Space Needle in Seattle Center. Inside, you will find world-class exhibits on Nirvana, Jimi Hendrix, science fiction, fantasy literature, and indie video games. The hands-on instruments in the Sound Lab let you pick up a guitar, sit behind a drum kit, or step into a vocal booth. A perfect rain-day option before a night game.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="travel-card">

            <p class="travel-card__distance">1 mile away &middot; Waterfront &amp; Dining</p>
            <p class="travel-card__desc">The recently renovated Seattle Waterfront stretches along Elliott Bay with sweeping views of Puget Sound and the Olympic Mountains. Ride the Seattle Great Wheel for a bird's-eye panorama, grab fresh seafood at one of the many harborside restaurants, book a harbor cruise, or stroll through the free Olympic Sculpture Park at the north end. The waterfront connects easily to Pike Place Market and Pioneer Square on foot.</p>

            <p class="travel-card__desc">Seattle's Chinatown-International District is right next to the ballpark and is one of the best pre-game food destinations in all of baseball. Explore Uwajimaya, the massive Asian supermarket and food hall, visit the Wing Luke Museum of the Asian Pacific American Experience, and eat your way through dim sum houses, pho restaurants, boba tea shops, and izakayas. It is authentic, affordable, and steps from the stadium gates.</p>

        <!-- Getting There -->
        <div class="content-block">
          <h2>Getting There</h2>
          <h3>Link Light Rail</h3>
          <p>The most convenient way to reach T-Mobile Park is the Link Light Rail. Take the 1 Line to Stadium station, which is directly adjacent to the ballpark. The light rail runs from the University of Washington through downtown Seattle and all the way to Sea-Tac Airport, making it an excellent option whether you are coming from a hotel downtown, the university district, or straight from the airport. Trains run frequently on game days, and the ride from Westlake station downtown takes about five minutes.</p>
          <h3>Sounder Commuter Rail</h3>
          <p>On game days, Sound Transit runs special Sounder commuter rail service to King Street Station, which sits right next to T-Mobile Park. This is a great option for fans coming from Tacoma, Puyallup, Kent, Auburn, and other communities to the south. Check the Sound Transit schedule for game-day service times, as Sounder trains do not run on every game day.</p>
          <h3>Walking from Pioneer Square</h3>
          <p>If you are staying downtown or exploring Pioneer Square before the game, T-Mobile Park is an easy 10-to-15-minute walk south along 1st Avenue. The walk takes you through the southern edge of Pioneer Square and into the SoDo district. Many fans combine a pre-game meal in Pioneer Square or the International District with the short walk to the ballpark.</p>
          <h3>Parking</h3>
          <p>Several parking lots are located south of the stadium along 1st Avenue South and Edgar Martinez Drive. Prices typically range from $20 to $50 on game days depending on proximity. Pre-booking through a parking app is recommended to guarantee a spot and avoid the worst of the post-game traffic. Be prepared for slow exits — the lots south of the park can bottleneck after the final out.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Fan Tips -->
        <div class="content-block">
          <h2>Fan Tips</h2>
          <div class="tip-box">
            <p class="tip-box__label">Garlic Fries Are Legendary</p>
            <p>The garlic fries at T-Mobile Park are not just good — they are a pilgrimage. This is where the ballpark garlic fry was invented, and they remain the gold standard. Get them early, because the lines at the garlic fry stands grow long by the third inning. They are available at multiple locations throughout the park, but the original stand on the main concourse behind home plate tends to draw the biggest crowds.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="tip-box">
            <p class="tip-box__label">Sit in The Pen for Home Run Balls</p>
            <p>The bullpen area in left field, known as The Pen, puts you in prime position to snag a home run ball during the game or a batting practice souvenir before first pitch. It is also one of the more affordable seating areas in the park and has a lively, social atmosphere with standing room, drink rails, and easy access to some of the best food concessions.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="tip-box">
            <p class="tip-box__label">The Roof Stays Open Unless Rain</p>
            <p>Seattle's reputation for rain is somewhat exaggerated during the summer months. The Mariners keep the roof open whenever possible, and it only closes when rain is actively falling or imminent. Summer evening games with the roof open and a clear sky are spectacular. If you are visiting in April, May, or September, bring a layer just in case — the roof may close and the air can be cool and damp even under cover.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="tip-box">
            <p class="tip-box__label">Ivar's Clam Chowder Is a Must</p>
            <p>Ivar's is a Seattle seafood institution dating back to 1938, and their clam chowder stand at T-Mobile Park serves the same creamy, rich chowder in a sourdough bread bowl. It is the perfect ballpark meal on a cool evening, especially if the roof is closed and there is a chill in the air. Pair it with a local IPA from one of the craft beer stands for the full Seattle experience.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <!-- Honest Drawbacks -->
        <div class="content-block">
          <h2>Honest Drawbacks</h2>
          <div class="drawback-box">
            <p class="drawback-box__label">SoDo Neighborhood Is Industrial</p>
            <p>T-Mobile Park sits in the SoDo district — South of Downtown — which is an industrial and warehouse area. Unlike ballparks in walkable entertainment districts, there is not much to do in the immediate surroundings. The blocks around the stadium are dominated by parking lots, rail yards, and commercial buildings. You will want to plan your pre-game time in Pioneer Square, the International District, or downtown rather than wandering the streets near the park.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="drawback-box">
            <p class="drawback-box__label">Can Be Cold and Damp</p>
            <p>Seattle summers are generally mild and pleasant, but early-season and late-season games can be genuinely cold and damp. Even with the roof closed, the stadium is not climate-controlled — it is open on the sides, and the marine air off Puget Sound can make evening games feel chilly. Bring layers for any game in April, May, or September. Even July and August evenings can cool off quickly after sunset.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="drawback-box">
            <p class="drawback-box__label">Upper Deck Feels Far from the Action</p>
            <p>T-Mobile Park has a capacity of nearly 48,000, and the upper deck seats are set back at a steep angle. If you are in the 300-level sections, particularly behind home plate or down the lines, the field can feel distant. The atmosphere up there is quieter, and you lose some of the intimacy that the lower bowl provides. If being close to the action matters, invest in 100-level or 200-level seats, or head to The Pen in left field for a more engaged experience.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="drawback-box">
            <p class="drawback-box__label">Post-Game I-5 Traffic</p>
            <p>If you drove to the game, be prepared for a slow exit. Interstate 5 runs directly past the stadium, and the on-ramps near the park become gridlocked after the final out. The surface streets in SoDo are not much better, with thousands of fans funneling into the same handful of routes. Taking the light rail is by far the smartest move. If you must drive, consider staying for 20 to 30 minutes after the game to let the worst of the traffic clear.</p>
