    <!-- What Makes Oracle Park Special -->

        <div class="content-block">
          <h2 id="special-heading">What Makes Oracle Park Special</h2>

          <p>Oracle Park is one of those rare stadiums that earns its reputation the moment you walk through the gates. Built on the shores of San Francisco Bay and opened in 2000, it was one of the first ballparks to prove that a modern stadium could feel intimate, rooted in its city, and genuinely beautiful all at once. Two decades later, it still sets the standard.</p>

          <h3>McCovey Cove &amp; Splash Hits</h3>
          <p>The defining feature of Oracle Park is McCovey Cove — the stretch of San Francisco Bay that sits directly behind the right-field wall. Named after Giants legend Willie McCovey, the cove has become the most iconic body of water in all of baseball. When a left-handed slugger gets hold of one and sends it over the right-field arcade, the ball splashes into the bay for a "splash hit." A counter inside the park tracks the running total. On game days, kayakers, stand-up paddleboarders, and small boats crowd the cove, jockeying for position in hopes of snagging a home-run ball straight out of the water. There is nothing else like it in professional sports.</p>

          <h3>The Bay Views</h3>
          <p>From almost every seat in the park, you get a panoramic view of the San Francisco Bay. The water shimmers beyond right field, boats drift past, and on clear evenings the East Bay hills glow in the sunset. The view is so good that you can lose track of the count just staring at the scenery. It is, without argument, the most scenic setting of any ballpark in Major League Baseball.</p>

          <h3>Best Food in Baseball</h3>
          <p>Oracle Park consistently ranks as the best food ballpark in MLB, and it is not close. The legendary garlic fries — thick-cut fries tossed with heaping amounts of freshly chopped garlic and parsley — are the signature dish and an absolute must-order. Beyond the fries, the concourse is loaded with Dungeness crab sandwiches, Ghirardelli hot fudge sundaes, Cha Cha Bowls, craft beer from local San Francisco breweries, and rotating specials that reflect the city's world-class culinary scene. This is not your average ballpark hot dog situation.</p>

          <h3>The Brick Facade &amp; Willie Mays</h3>
          <p>The park's exterior is wrapped in a handsome red-brick facade that gives it a timeless, classic look despite being a 21st-century build. At the main entrance on Willie Mays Plaza, a towering bronze statue of Willie Mays — the Say Hey Kid — greets fans with his signature swing. The address itself, 24 Willie Mays Plaza, honors his iconic number 24. Every detail of this park was designed to feel like it belongs to San Francisco.</p>

          <h3>Intimate Despite Being Modern</h3>
          <p>At 41,265 seats, Oracle Park is one of the smaller stadiums in MLB, and that is entirely by design. The seating bowl wraps tightly around the field, keeping fans close to the action. There are no cavernous upper decks or bad sight lines. Even the cheap seats feel connected to the game. The architects understood that a ballpark should feel like a neighborhood gathering place, not a concrete colosseum, and Oracle Park delivers that warmth on every level.</p>

          <h2 id="travel-heading">Local Travel &amp; Nearby Attractions</h2>
          <p>San Francisco is one of the great travel cities in the world, and Oracle Park sits in one of its best neighborhoods. Here are the spots worth your time before or after the game.</p>

          <div class="travel-card">
            <h3 class="travel-card__title">Ferry Building Marketplace</h3>
            <p class="travel-card__distance">1.5 miles from Oracle Park</p>
            <p class="travel-card__desc">San Francisco's premier artisan food hall and one of the best farmers markets on the West Coast. Browse local cheeses, handmade chocolates, freshly shucked oysters, and craft coffee inside the beautifully restored 1898 building. The Saturday morning farmers market on the Embarcadero is legendary. The historic clock tower and waterfront views make it worth the walk even if you are not hungry.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="travel-card">
            <h3 class="travel-card__title">McCovey Cove Boardwalk</h3>
            <p class="travel-card__distance">Steps away from Oracle Park</p>
            <p class="travel-card__desc">You do not need a ticket to enjoy Oracle Park. The public boardwalk along the waterfront behind right field features free viewing windows where you can watch the game through chain-link cutouts in the outfield wall. The kayak viewing area in McCovey Cove is a spectacle in itself — dozens of boats jockeying for splash-hit position. Walk the promenade, grab garlic fries from an outside vendor, and soak up the atmosphere.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="travel-card">
            <h3 class="travel-card__title">Fisherman's Wharf &amp; Pier 39</h3>
            <p class="travel-card__distance">4 miles from Oracle Park</p>
            <p class="travel-card__desc">Touristy? Sure. Still worth doing? Absolutely. Watch the famous sea lions lounging on the docks at Pier 39, grab a sourdough bread bowl of clam chowder, and stroll through Ghirardelli Square for chocolate samples. The real draw here is the bay cruises and Alcatraz ferries — book your Alcatraz tickets well in advance, because they sell out weeks ahead.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="travel-card">
            <h3 class="travel-card__title">Mission District</h3>
            <p class="travel-card__distance">3 miles from Oracle Park</p>
            <p class="travel-card__desc">The Mission is where locals eat, and for good reason. This neighborhood serves some of the best burritos in the world — La Taqueria and El Farolito are the headliners in that eternal debate. Beyond the food, the Mission is packed with vibrant street murals (especially along Balmy Alley and Clarion Alley), Dolores Park for people-watching with skyline views, and a buzzing nightlife scene that keeps going long after last call.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="travel-card">
            <h3 class="travel-card__title">Golden Gate Bridge</h3>
            <p class="travel-card__distance">7 miles from Oracle Park</p>
            <p class="travel-card__desc">No trip to San Francisco is complete without seeing the Golden Gate Bridge. Walk or bike across the 1.7-mile span for staggering views of the bay, the city, and the Pacific Ocean. On the Marin County side, Battery Spencer offers the classic postcard vista point. On the San Francisco side, Crissy Field provides a beautiful waterfront trail leading right up to the bridge with the city skyline behind you.</p>

          <h2 id="getting-there-heading">Getting There</h2>
          <p>Oracle Park is well connected by public transit, and driving is not recommended on game days unless you enjoy sitting in traffic and paying premium parking rates. Here are your best options.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Muni Metro N-Judah Line:</strong> The N-Judah light rail runs directly to the park, stopping at 2nd &amp; King Street just a short walk from the gates. It is the easiest and most popular transit option for most fans.</li>
            <li><strong>Caltrain:</strong> If you are coming from the Peninsula or South Bay, Caltrain drops you at 4th &amp; King Station, about a 10-minute walk to the park. Special game-day trains run on the schedule for night games.</li>
            <li><strong>Ferry from the East Bay:</strong> The San Francisco Bay Ferry runs game-day service from Oakland and Alameda directly to the park's ferry landing. Arriving by water with the ballpark rising up ahead of you is one of the great approaches in all of sports.</li>
            <li><strong>Driving &amp; Parking:</strong> Several paid parking lots surround the stadium, but they fill up fast and rates spike on game days. If you must drive, arrive early or book parking in advance through a reservation app. Street parking in the surrounding SoMa neighborhood is limited and competitive.</li>

            <p>The garlic fries are mandatory. Do not leave Oracle Park without ordering at least one basket — they are the single most iconic ballpark food item in all of MLB, and they live up to the hype. Your hands will smell like garlic for the rest of the night, and you will not regret it.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="tip-box">
            <p class="tip-box__label">Free Views</p>
            <p>Walk the Promenade along the waterfront behind right field for free views of the game even without a ticket. The public viewing areas along the right-field wall give you a genuine look at the action, and on a nice evening, the vibe out there is electric. It is one of the best free experiences in baseball.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="tip-box">
            <p class="tip-box__label">Dessert Destination</p>
            <p>Save room for a Ghirardelli sundae. San Francisco's legendary chocolate company has a stand inside the park, and the hot fudge sundae is the perfect way to cap off a night at the ballpark. Rich, indulgent, and uniquely San Francisco.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="tip-box">
            <p class="tip-box__label">Best Seat in the House</p>
            <p>Sit in the view reserved section along the first-base side for a stunning bay panorama. You get the water, the boats, the East Bay hills, and the sunset all in one sweeping view. It is the single best vantage point in Major League Baseball, and the tickets are often more affordable than you would expect.</p>

        <div class="content-block">
          <h2 id="drawbacks-heading">Honest Drawbacks</h2>
          <p>Every ballpark has its rough edges. Here is what to know before you go.</p>

          <div class="drawback-box">
            <p class="drawback-box__label">Cold &amp; Windy</p>
            <p>This is the big one. Oracle Park is cold and windy, especially at night, and especially in summer. San Francisco's famous marine layer means that a sunny 70-degree afternoon can turn into a 52-degree, wind-whipped evening by the seventh inning stretch. Bring layers. Bring a jacket. Bring a beanie. Do not make the rookie mistake of showing up in shorts and a t-shirt because the daytime forecast looked warm.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="drawback-box">
            <p class="drawback-box__label">Karl the Fog Is Real</p>
            <p>San Francisco's fog has its own name — Karl — and its own Instagram account, and it is not a joke. Karl rolls in off the Pacific with ruthless consistency, blanketing the waterfront and the ballpark in a thick grey mist that can drop visibility and temperatures fast. Night games in July can feel like October. Check the fog forecast before you go, and plan accordingly.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="drawback-box">
            <p class="drawback-box__label">Expensive Tickets</p>
            <p>San Francisco is one of the most expensive cities in the country, and Oracle Park ticket prices reflect that. Even in down years for the Giants, ticket prices remain well above the MLB average. Concessions are similarly pricey. Budget accordingly, especially if you are feeding a family.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="drawback-box">
            <p class="drawback-box__label">Post-Game Congestion</p>
            <p>Getting out of the park after a game can be slow. The surrounding streets and transit lines get congested quickly, and the Muni and Caltrain platforms can be packed. Consider staying for 15 to 20 minutes after the final out to let the initial rush clear, or head to a nearby bar in the SoMa neighborhood and wait it out.</p>

            <summary itemprop="name">What food is Oracle Park known for?</summary>
            <div class="faq-answer" itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer">
              <p itemprop="text">Oracle Park is widely regarded as having the best food in Major League Baseball. The park's signature item is its legendary garlic fries — thick-cut fries tossed with chopped fresh garlic and parsley. Other standout options include Dungeness crab sandwiches, Ghirardelli hot fudge sundaes, Crazy Crab'z crab sandwiches, Cha Cha Bowls, and local craft beer. The food at Oracle Park reflects San Francisco's world-class culinary culture.</p>

            <summary itemprop="name">Is Oracle Park cold at night?</summary>
            <div class="faq-answer" itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer">
              <p itemprop="text">Yes, Oracle Park is notoriously cold at night, even during summer. San Francisco's famous fog — nicknamed Karl the Fog — regularly rolls in off the bay during evening games, and temperatures can drop into the low 50s or even upper 40s (Fahrenheit) after sunset. Fans should always bring layers, a jacket, and a beanie or hat regardless of the daytime forecast. The park's waterfront location amplifies the wind chill, especially in exposed seating areas.</p>
