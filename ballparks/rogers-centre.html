The Montreal Expos previously played at Olympic Stadium in Montreal from 1977 to 2004 before relocating to Washington, D.C. and becoming the Nationals. There have been periodic discussions about bringing a second MLB franchise back to Montreal, but as of now, Rogers Centre stands alone as the sole international MLB venue.

This applies to all travellers, including children. A standard driver's license is not sufficient for crossing the Canada-U.S. border by air, and even land crossings require a passport or an approved alternative document under the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative. Make sure your passport is not expired and has at least six months of validity remaining. If you are flying into Toronto, you will clear Canadian customs at the airport. If you are driving from nearby cities like Buffalo or Detroit, expect border crossing wait times that can vary significantly depending on the day and time. Plan accordingly and bring your documents."

When it opened in 1989 as SkyDome, it was the first stadium in the world with a fully retractable motorized roof, and this engineering achievement was considered a marvel of its era. The roof consists of four panels — three of which slide on rail tracks and one that rotates — that stack together when open to reveal the sky above the playing field and a stunning view of the CN Tower looming overhead. The decision to open or close the roof on game day is made by stadium operations based on weather conditions, including temperature, rain forecast, and wind. When the roof is open on a warm summer evening, the atmosphere inside Rogers Centre is dramatically better — fresh air, natural light, and the CN Tower lit up against the Toronto skyline make for an unforgettable setting. Fans generally agree that a roof-open game is a far superior experience."

        <!-- What Makes Rogers Centre Special -->
        <div class="content-block">
          <h2>What Makes Rogers Centre Special</h2>
          <p>When Rogers Centre opened in 1989 — originally under the name SkyDome — it was one of the most ambitious pieces of stadium engineering the world had ever seen. It was the first stadium on the planet with a fully retractable motorized roof, a feat that required four massive interlocking panels, three sliding on rail tracks and one rotating, all capable of opening or closing in roughly 20 minutes. At the time, it was an engineering marvel that drew global attention and redefined what a multi-purpose stadium could be. The technology that made SkyDome possible in 1989 directly influenced every retractable-roof stadium that followed.</p>

          <h3>The CN Tower</h3>
          <p>There is no more dramatic backdrop in all of Major League Baseball. The CN Tower — standing 1,815 feet tall and once the world's tallest free-standing structure — rises directly adjacent to Rogers Centre. When the retractable roof is open, the tower looms overhead in a way that is genuinely awe-inspiring, especially as night falls and its LED lighting illuminates against the Toronto skyline. From upper-deck seats on a clear evening with the roof pulled back, the view of the CN Tower against the darkening sky is one of the most iconic sightlines in the sport. It is a visual that simply does not exist anywhere else in baseball.</p>

          <h3>The Only MLB Park Outside the United States</h3>
          <p>Rogers Centre holds a distinction no other current ballpark can claim: it is the only Major League Baseball stadium located outside the United States. Since the Montreal Expos relocated to Washington in 2005, the Blue Jays have carried the flag as the sole international franchise in MLB. Walking into Rogers Centre means crossing a national border, clearing customs, spending Canadian dollars, and experiencing baseball in a different country. For American fans making the trip north, it adds a layer of novelty and adventure that no domestic road trip can replicate. For Canadian fans, the Blue Jays represent an entire country's connection to the sport.</p>

          <h3>The Hotel That Overlooks the Field</h3>
          <p>One of Rogers Centre's most unusual features is the Toronto Marriott City Centre Hotel, built directly into the stadium structure with 70 rooms that have floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking the playing field. Guests can literally watch a Blue Jays game from the comfort of their hotel room — one of the most unique accommodation experiences in professional sports. The rooms with field views sell out months in advance for popular games, and they have occasionally made headlines when guests have forgotten to close their curtains during broadcasts.</p>

          <h3>1992 and 1993 World Series</h3>
          <p>Rogers Centre — then SkyDome — was the home of back-to-back World Series champions in 1992 and 1993, the only Canadian franchise to win baseball's ultimate prize. The 1993 series ended in legendary fashion when Joe Carter hit a walk-off home run in Game 6 against the Philadelphia Phillies, one of only two walk-off home runs to ever clinch a World Series. That moment remains one of the most replayed highlights in baseball history, and for an entire generation of Canadian baseball fans, it is the defining memory of the sport. The echoes of Carter's home run trot around the SkyDome bases still resonate through the building.</p>

        <div class="content-block">
          <h2>Local Travel &amp; Nearby Attractions</h2>
          <p>Toronto is one of the most vibrant, diverse, and culturally rich cities in North America. The ballpark sits right in the heart of the downtown core, making it easy to pair your game with world-class attractions, food, and exploration. Here are the top spots to visit while you are in the city.</p>

          <div class="travel-card">
            <h3 class="travel-card__title">CN Tower</h3>
            <p class="travel-card__distance">Adjacent</p>
            <p class="travel-card__desc">The CN Tower is Toronto's defining landmark and stands directly next to Rogers Centre. At 1,815 feet tall, it held the record as the world's tallest free-standing structure for over 30 years. The main observation deck offers panoramic views of the entire Greater Toronto Area and, on clear days, you can see across Lake Ontario to the mist of Niagara Falls. The Glass Floor — 1,122 feet above the ground — is a thrilling test of nerve for those who dare to look straight down. For the truly adventurous, the EdgeWalk allows you to walk hands-free along the outside ledge of the tower's main pod, harnessed to an overhead rail, 116 storeys above the city. The revolving restaurant, 360, serves upscale Canadian cuisine while slowly rotating to give diners a full panoramic view over the course of their meal. The CN Tower is a city icon and an absolute must-visit when attending a game at Rogers Centre.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="travel-card">
            <h3 class="travel-card__title">Distillery District</h3>
            <p class="travel-card__distance">3 km</p>
            <p class="travel-card__desc">The Distillery District is a beautifully preserved collection of Victorian-era industrial buildings that once housed the Gooderham and Worts whisky distillery, at one time the largest distillery in the world. Today, the cobblestone streets and restored red-brick warehouses are home to independent art galleries, boutique shops, craft breweries, artisan studios, restaurants, and cafes. The entire district is pedestrian-only, giving it a relaxed, European-village feel that is unlike anything else in Toronto. It is one of the most photogenic and atmospheric neighborhoods in the city, and on a warm evening before or after a Blue Jays game, it is an ideal place to wander, eat, and soak in Toronto's creative energy.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="travel-card">
            <h3 class="travel-card__title">St. Lawrence Market</h3>
            <p class="travel-card__distance">2 km</p>
            <p class="travel-card__desc">St. Lawrence Market was voted the world's best food market by National Geographic, and it has been feeding Torontonians for over 200 years. The South Market building is the main attraction, packed with vendors selling fresh produce, artisan cheeses, baked goods, meats, seafood, and prepared foods from cuisines around the world. The essential order is the peameal bacon sandwich from Carousel Bakery — a thick slab of cornmeal-crusted Canadian back bacon on a soft kaiser roll, a Toronto culinary institution that is as iconic to this city as a hot dog is to New York. On Saturday mornings, a farmers' market fills the adjacent space with seasonal Ontario produce. It is a food lover's paradise and one of the great market experiences in North America.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="travel-card">
            <h3 class="travel-card__title">Royal Ontario Museum</h3>
            <p class="travel-card__distance">3 km</p>
            <p class="travel-card__desc">The Royal Ontario Museum — universally known as the ROM — is one of the largest museums in North America, housing a vast collection spanning natural history, world cultures, art, and science. The museum's holdings include extraordinary dinosaur galleries, ancient Egyptian artifacts, Chinese temple art, and extensive galleries dedicated to Indigenous Canadian peoples. The building itself is a landmark: the Michael Lee-Chin Crystal, a dramatic jagged aluminum-and-glass extension designed by Daniel Libeskind, juts out from the original heritage building in a collision of old and new that is architecturally striking from every angle. The ROM is easily accessible by subway and is the kind of museum you could spend an entire day exploring.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="travel-card">
            <h3 class="travel-card__title">Toronto Islands</h3>
            <p class="travel-card__distance">Ferry from Harbourfront</p>
            <p class="travel-card__desc">A short ferry ride from the Harbourfront terminal — just minutes from Rogers Centre — takes you to the Toronto Islands, a chain of small, car-free islands in Lake Ontario that feel like an entirely different world from the bustling downtown core. Centre Island is the main destination, with sprawling green spaces, walking and cycling paths, a small amusement park, and some of the best public beaches in the Toronto area. Bike rentals are readily available, and pedalling around the islands with the dramatic Toronto skyline rising across the water behind you is one of the most enjoyable experiences the city has to offer. On a warm summer afternoon before an evening Blue Jays game, the islands are the perfect escape.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <!-- Getting There -->
        <div class="content-block">
          <h2>Getting There</h2>
          <h3>TTC Subway &amp; Union Station</h3>
          <p>Rogers Centre is located steps from Union Station, the central hub of Toronto's transit system and one of the busiest transportation centres in Canada. The TTC subway delivers you directly to Union Station on both the Yonge-University line and the Bloor-Danforth line, and from there it is a short walk south through the SkyWalk — a covered, climate-controlled pedestrian bridge — directly to the stadium. On game days, Union Station is bustling with Blue Jays fans, and the subway is by far the easiest and most efficient way to reach the park from anywhere in the city.</p>
          <h3>GO Transit</h3>
          <p>For fans coming from the Greater Toronto Area suburbs, GO Transit commuter trains from across the region converge at Union Station. Lines run from Hamilton, Oshawa, Barrie, and other surrounding communities, making Rogers Centre accessible from well beyond the city core without needing to drive or deal with downtown parking. GO trains run frequent post-game service to handle the surge of fans leaving the stadium, so getting home after a night game is straightforward.</p>
          <h3>Billy Bishop Airport</h3>
          <p>Billy Bishop Toronto City Airport sits on the Toronto Islands, just a few minutes from Rogers Centre. It handles regional flights from airlines like Porter, and its proximity to the downtown core makes it incredibly convenient for fans flying in from nearby cities like Montreal, Ottawa, Boston, or New York. A pedestrian tunnel connects the island airport to the mainland, and from there it is a quick taxi, streetcar, or walk to the ballpark. For a quick baseball trip to Toronto, Billy Bishop is a remarkably efficient way to arrive.</p>
          <h3>PATH Underground Walkway</h3>
          <p>Toronto's PATH system is a massive underground pedestrian network stretching over 30 kilometres beneath the downtown core, connecting Union Station, office towers, shopping centres, and hotels. On rainy or cold game days, you can walk from your hotel to Rogers Centre entirely underground without ever stepping outside. The PATH is well-signed and climate-controlled, and it is one of those Toronto features that visiting fans do not always know about but appreciate enormously once they discover it.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Fan Tips -->
        <div class="content-block">
          <h2>Fan Tips</h2>
          <div class="tip-box">
            <p class="tip-box__label">Insider Tips</p>
            <p>Sit in the 500 level for the best CN Tower views. The upper deck gets a lot of criticism for being far from the field, and that criticism is fair, but the compensating reward is a dramatic perspective that includes the CN Tower rising above the open roof on clear evenings. When the tower is lit up at night and the roof is pulled back, the 500 level offers a panoramic scene that lower-bowl seats simply cannot provide. It is one of the genuinely unique sightlines in all of baseball.</p>
            <p>Try a peameal bacon sandwich. Whether you get one at St. Lawrence Market before the game or at a concession stand inside Rogers Centre, the peameal bacon sandwich is Toronto's signature food — cornmeal-crusted Canadian back bacon on a soft roll, simple and deeply satisfying. It is to Toronto what a cheesesteak is to Philadelphia or a Dodger Dog is to Los Angeles. Do not leave the city without eating one.</p>
            <p>If you are visiting from the United States, remember that you need a valid passport to enter Canada. This catches some fans off guard, especially those driving from nearby border cities like Buffalo or Detroit. A standard driver's license will not get you across the border. Make sure your passport is current and has adequate validity remaining before you plan your trip.</p>
            <p>A game with the roof open is a completely different experience from one with it closed. When the roof is open on a warm summer evening, the fresh air, the natural light, and the CN Tower overhead transform Rogers Centre from a concrete dome into something genuinely special. If you have flexibility in scheduling your visit, check the weather forecast and aim for a game when the roof is likely to be open. The difference is significant.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <!-- Honest Drawbacks -->
        <div class="content-block">
          <h2>Honest Drawbacks</h2>
          <div class="drawback-box">
            <p class="drawback-box__label">Worth Knowing</p>
            <p>Rogers Centre is an aging concrete dome, and it shows. The building opened in 1989 as a multi-purpose facility, and while it was revolutionary for its time, the interior architecture lacks the charm, warmth, and character of the baseball-specific parks that have defined the modern era. The concourses are grey and utilitarian, the seating bowl feels cavernous and impersonal, and the overall aesthetic owes more to 1980s civic engineering than to any vision of what a baseball experience should feel like. The Blue Jays have invested in renovations to modernize sections of the park, but the fundamental structure remains a product of its era.</p>
            <p>The artificial turf playing surface is a persistent sore spot for baseball purists. While the current turf is a significant improvement over the old carpet-like AstroTurf that once covered the field, it is still not natural grass. The ball behaves differently, the field lacks the organic beauty of real turf, and for fans who care about the traditional aesthetics of the game, the synthetic surface is a constant visual reminder that Rogers Centre was built for function over beauty.</p>
            <p>When Rogers Centre is not sold out — which is common during weeknight games against non-marquee opponents — the stadium can feel cavernous and empty. The park was built to hold nearly 50,000 fans, and when attendance dips to 20,000 or 25,000, the vastness of the concrete bowl becomes very apparent. The atmosphere thins, the sound dissipates into the dome, and the intimate baseball experience you find at smaller, purpose-built parks is simply not achievable here on a quiet Tuesday night.</p>
            <p>Concessions at Rogers Centre are expensive, even by Major League Baseball standards, and the Canadian dollar exchange rate can make it sting even more for American visitors. A beer, a hot dog, and a snack will cost you noticeably more than at most parks south of the border. Toronto is a world-class city with world-class prices, and that extends into the stadium. Budget accordingly, and consider eating before you arrive.</p>
            <p>The sightlines from the upper deck are far from the playing field. The 500 level at Rogers Centre is high, steep, and a long way from the action. While the panoramic view of the CN Tower is a consolation, there is no getting around the fact that you are watching baseball from a considerable distance. If proximity to the game matters to you, invest in lower-bowl tickets. The upper deck is affordable for a reason.</p>

              <summary itemprop="name">Is Rogers Centre the only MLB stadium in Canada?</summary>
              <div class="faq-answer" itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer">
                <p itemprop="text">Yes, Rogers Centre in Toronto is currently the only Major League Baseball stadium located in Canada and the only one outside the United States. The Montreal Expos previously played at Olympic Stadium in Montreal from 1977 to 2004 before relocating to Washington, D.C. and becoming the Nationals. There have been periodic discussions about bringing a second MLB franchise back to Montreal, but as of now, Rogers Centre stands alone as the sole international MLB venue. This makes a trip to see the Blue Jays a unique cross-border baseball experience, and visiting fans from the United States should remember that a valid passport or equivalent travel document is required to enter Canada.</p>

              <summary itemprop="name">Do you need a passport to see the Blue Jays?</summary>
              <div class="faq-answer" itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer">
                <p itemprop="text">Yes, if you are travelling from the United States to see the Toronto Blue Jays at Rogers Centre, you will need a valid passport, passport card, or a NEXUS card to enter Canada and to re-enter the United States. This applies to all travellers, including children. A standard driver's license is not sufficient for crossing the Canada-U.S. border by air, and even land crossings require a passport or an approved alternative document under the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative. Make sure your passport is not expired and has at least six months of validity remaining. If you are flying into Toronto, you will clear Canadian customs at the airport. If you are driving from nearby cities like Buffalo or Detroit, expect border crossing wait times that can vary significantly depending on the day and time. Plan accordingly and bring your documents.</p>

              <summary itemprop="name">Does the Rogers Centre roof open?</summary>
              <div class="faq-answer" itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer">
                <p itemprop="text">Yes, Rogers Centre has a fully retractable roof that can open and close in approximately 20 minutes. When it opened in 1989 as SkyDome, it was the first stadium in the world with a fully retractable motorized roof, and this engineering achievement was considered a marvel of its era. The roof consists of four panels — three of which slide on rail tracks and one that rotates — that stack together when open to reveal the sky above the playing field and a stunning view of the CN Tower looming overhead. The decision to open or close the roof on game day is made by stadium operations based on weather conditions, including temperature, rain forecast, and wind. When the roof is open on a warm summer evening, the atmosphere inside Rogers Centre is dramatically better — fresh air, natural light, and the CN Tower lit up against the Toronto skyline make for an unforgettable setting. Fans generally agree that a roof-open game is a far superior experience.</p>
