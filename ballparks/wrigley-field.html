      <!-- What Makes Wrigley Field Special -->
      <section class="content-block" aria-labelledby="what-makes-special">
        <h2 id="what-makes-special">What Makes Wrigley Field Special</h2>
        <p>Wrigley Field is not just a ballpark. It is a living artifact of baseball history, wedged into a residential neighborhood on Chicago's North Side, surrounded by apartment buildings, corner bars, and the electric energy of Wrigleyville. Opened in 1914 and home to the Cubs since 1916, it is the second-oldest active ballpark in Major League Baseball and one of the most cherished stadiums in all of professional sports.</p>

        <h3>The Ivy-Covered Outfield Walls</h3>
        <p>Planted in 1937 by Bill Veeck, the ivy that covers Wrigley's outfield walls is the park's most iconic feature. By late summer the walls are a lush green curtain of Boston ivy and Japanese bittersweet. A ball lost in the ivy is ruled a ground-rule double, a rule unique to this park. There is nothing else like it in professional baseball.</p>

        <h3>The Hand-Operated Scoreboard</h3>
        <p>Rising above the center field bleachers, the scoreboard at Wrigley has been manually operated since 1937. Workers inside the board change the inning-by-inning scores of every Major League game by hand using metal number plates. It remains one of the last hand-turned scoreboards in baseball, a stubborn and beautiful holdout against the digital age.</p>

        <h3>Rooftop Seating Across Waveland and Sheffield</h3>
        <p>The buildings across Waveland Avenue and Sheffield Avenue beyond the outfield walls have been converted into rooftop seating areas, offering a uniquely Chicago way to watch a game. These rooftop clubs serve food and drinks with a view directly into the ballpark. Though some sightlines were affected by the 2014-2019 renovation and new video boards, the rooftops remain an unmissable part of the Wrigley experience.</p>

        <h3>Day Baseball Tradition</h3>
        <p>Wrigley Field was the last Major League park to install permanent lights, holding out until 1988. The tradition of day baseball is still alive: the Cubs play more day games than any other team, and there is nothing quite like a sunny afternoon at Wrigley with a cold beer and a Chicago dog. Afternoon games at Wrigley have a rhythm and atmosphere that night games at other parks simply cannot replicate.</p>

        <h3>The Friendly Confines</h3>
        <p>Ernie Banks coined the nickname, and it stuck. Wrigley's intimate size, its proximity to the street, and the way the neighborhood wraps around the park on all sides give it a warmth and accessibility that modern stadiums cannot reproduce. You can hear the crowd from blocks away. You can smell the hot dogs from the L platform. The park feels like it belongs to the city in a way few venues do.</p>

        <h3>The Marquee Sign</h3>
        <p>The red Wrigley Field marquee at the corner of Clark and Addison is one of the most photographed landmarks in Chicago. It has welcomed fans since 1934 and serves as the unofficial meeting point before every game. Whether it reads "Home of Chicago Cubs" or announces a concert, the marquee is the front door to one of baseball's great cathedrals.</p>

          <p class="travel-card__distance">Steps away</p>
          <p class="travel-card__desc">The blocks surrounding Wrigley Field are the best ballpark neighborhood in baseball. Murphy's Bleachers is the legendary pre-game bar directly across from the bleacher entrance. Sluggers has batting cages and a dueling piano bar upstairs. Clark Street is lined with sports bars, restaurants, and souvenir shops. After a win, the neighborhood erupts. After a loss, it consoles you. Either way, you will not want to leave.</p>

The adjacent Lincoln Park Conservatory and North Pond are also worth exploring.</p>

It is touristy, but the views of the skyline from the pier at sunset are hard to beat. Take the CTA bus #29 from the Wrigleyville area or ride the Red Line south and transfer.</p>

      <!-- Getting There -->
      <section class="content-block" aria-labelledby="getting-there">
        <h2 id="getting-there">Getting There</h2>
        <p>Wrigley Field is one of the most transit-accessible ballparks in Major League Baseball. The CTA Red Line Addison station is steps from the main entrance at Clark and Addison. Step off the train, walk half a block, and you are at the ballpark. It is that simple.</p>
        <p>Several CTA bus routes also serve the area, including the #152 Addison, #22 Clark, and #8 Halsted lines. All drop off within a short walk of the gates.</p>
        <p>If you are driving, know this: parking in Wrigleyville is scarce and expensive on game days. Street parking is restricted to permit holders in the surrounding residential blocks. Private lots and garages exist but fill up fast and charge premium prices. The overwhelming recommendation for Wrigley Field is to take the L. It is faster, cheaper, and part of the experience.</p>

        <div class="tip-box">
          <p class="tip-box__label">Insider Tips</p>
          <p>Sit in the bleachers for the best atmosphere. The bleacher section at Wrigley is its own universe: louder, rowdier, and more social than the rest of the park. It is the section where traditions live.</p>
          <p>Grab an Old Style beer. It is the unofficial beer of Wrigley Field and has been for decades. It is cheap, it is cold, and it tastes better here than anywhere else on Earth. Trust the tradition.</p>
          <p>Do not miss the seventh-inning stretch. Wrigley's version is famous: a guest conductor leads the crowd in "Take Me Out to the Ball Game" from the broadcast booth, a tradition started by Harry Caray. Stand up, sing loud, and do not be shy.</p>
          <p>Arrive early and walk Clark Street. The pre-game scene in Wrigleyville is half the experience. Grab food, duck into a bar, soak in the energy. The neighborhood comes alive hours before first pitch.</p>
        </div>

      <!-- Honest Drawbacks -->
      <section class="content-block" aria-labelledby="honest-drawbacks">
        <h2 id="honest-drawbacks">Honest Drawbacks</h2>
        <div class="drawback-box">
          <p class="drawback-box__label">Worth Knowing</p>
          <p>Parking is essentially nonexistent. If you drive, you will pay a premium for a private lot and still walk several blocks. The CTA is the only sane option.</p>
          <p>The concourses are cramped. Wrigley was built in 1914 and it shows in the narrow walkways and tight corridors behind the seating bowl. Getting food or finding a restroom during a packed game requires patience.</p>
          <p>Some seats have obstructed views. Support columns and structural beams from the original construction can partially block sightlines in certain sections of the upper deck and behind home plate. Check your seat map before buying.</p>
          <p>The neighborhood gets very crowded on game days. Wrigleyville is a party, and that is part of its charm, but it also means packed sidewalks, long bar waits, and noise levels that are not for everyone. Plan accordingly if you are traveling with small children or prefer a quieter experience.</p>
