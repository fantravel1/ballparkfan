Grab a Spotted Cow from New Glarus Brewing, a beloved Wisconsin craft beer that is only available in the state and has become the unofficial beer of Brewers fans. For something more substantial, look for the pulled pork nachos or the Milwaukee-style frozen custard for dessert. But start with the brat. Always start with the brat."

      <!-- What Makes American Family Field Special -->
      <section class="content-block" aria-labelledby="what-makes-special">
        <h2 id="what-makes-special">What Makes American Family Field Special</h2>
        <p>American Family Field is one of the most distinctive ballparks in Major League Baseball, a place where engineering marvel meets Midwestern warmth in a way that no other stadium in the country can replicate. Opened in 2001 as Miller Park, it was built to solve a genuine problem -- how do you play baseball in Wisconsin, where April and October games can mean freezing rain, snow, and wind chill -- and the solution turned out to be something extraordinary. This is not a dome. This is not an open-air park. This is something entirely its own.</p>

        <h3>The Fan-Shaped Retractable Roof</h3>
        <p>The defining feature of American Family Field is its unique fan-shaped retractable roof, a seven-panel structure that opens and closes like a giant folding fan. It is unlike any other retractable roof in professional sports. While other stadiums use sliding panels that move along parallel tracks, the American Family Field roof pivots from a point near home plate, with the panels sweeping outward and stacking behind the outfield wall when open. The engineering is remarkable. The entire roof weighs over 12,000 tons and can open or close in approximately ten minutes. When the roof is open on a perfect summer evening, the park feels like an outdoor stadium with the Wisconsin sky overhead. When it is closed on a cold April night, the park is warm, comfortable, and fully enclosed. It is the best of both worlds, and it means that no Brewers game is ever rained out.</p>

        <h3>The Best Tailgating in Baseball</h3>
        <p>If there is one thing that every baseball fan needs to experience, it is the tailgating at American Family Field. This is not a casual thing. This is not a few fans grilling hot dogs in a corner of the parking lot. This is a full-scale, stadium-wide phenomenon that rivals anything in the NFL. The parking lots open hours before first pitch, and by the time the gates are ready, thousands of fans have their grills fired up, their coolers open, their cornhole boards set, and their lawn chairs arranged in sprawling pre-game gatherings that feel more like a neighborhood block party than a ballpark pregame. Bratwurst is the centerpiece, cooked on every kind of grill imaginable, and the smell of charcoal and sizzling meat hangs in the air from one end of the lot to the other. The tailgating culture at American Family Field is the best in baseball. It is not close. It is deeply, authentically Wisconsin, and it is one of the great experiences in all of American sports.</p>

        <h3>Bernie Brewer's Slide</h3>
        <p>When a Brewers player hits a home run, the team mascot Bernie Brewer goes down a giant yellow slide in the left-field terrace, landing on a platform above the crowd. The slide is a beloved tradition that dates back to the team's days at County Stadium, where Bernie originally slid into a giant beer mug. The mug is gone, but the slide remains, and the sight of Bernie launching himself down the chute after a home run never gets old. It is silly and wonderful, and the crowd roars every time.</p>

        <h3>The Famous Racing Sausages</h3>
        <p>The sausage race is one of the most iconic traditions in all of baseball. During the bottom of the sixth inning at every home game, five oversized costumed sausages -- the Bratwurst, Polish Sausage, Italian Sausage, Hot Dog, and Chorizo -- race around the warning track while the entire stadium cheers, boos, and picks sides. What started as a simple scoreboard animation in the early 1990s has become a nationally recognized spectacle. The sausages stumble, collide, take shortcuts, and occasionally wipe out in spectacular fashion. It is pure, unbridled fun, and it captures the spirit of American Family Field perfectly. Every fan has a favorite sausage, and arguments about which one deserves to win are a serious matter in Milwaukee.</p>

        <h3>Real Grass Under a Roof</h3>
        <p>American Family Field is one of the very few stadiums in baseball that features a natural grass playing surface under a retractable roof. When the roof is closed, special grow lights and ventilation systems keep the grass healthy and green. It is a remarkable horticultural achievement and a testament to the Brewers' commitment to providing an authentic baseball experience. The grass is real, the dirt is real, and the playing surface looks and plays like any top-tier outdoor ballpark. Fans who have visited other roofed stadiums with artificial turf will immediately notice the difference.</p>

        <h3>Midwestern Warmth</h3>
        <p>Milwaukee is one of the friendliest cities in America, and that warmth radiates through every corner of American Family Field. Brewers fans are welcoming, generous, and genuinely happy to share their ballpark with visitors. There is no edge here, no attitude, no hostility toward opposing fans. People offer you brats from their tailgate. They strike up conversations about the game. They make you feel like you belong. The Midwestern hospitality at American Family Field is not a marketing slogan -- it is the lived reality of attending a game in Milwaukee, and it makes the experience warmer than the bratwurst on the grill.</p>

      <section class="content-block" aria-labelledby="nearby-attractions">
        <h2 id="nearby-attractions">Local Travel</h2>
        <p>Milwaukee is a city that consistently surprises visitors with its depth, character, and charm. From the historic Third Ward to the lakefront, there is far more here than most people expect. The stadium sits west of downtown, so plan to explore the city before or after the game.</p>

        <div class="travel-card">
          <h3 class="travel-card__title">Milwaukee Riverwalk &amp; Third Ward</h3>
          <p class="travel-card__distance">8 miles</p>
          <p class="travel-card__desc">The Historic Third Ward is Milwaukee's most vibrant neighborhood, a former warehouse district transformed into a walkable collection of independent shops, galleries, restaurants, and cafes. The Milwaukee Public Market is the anchor, a European-style indoor market where you can grab fresh cheese curds, artisan bread, craft coffee, and a stunning array of local food. The Milwaukee Riverwalk threads through the district along the Milwaukee River, offering scenic views, public art installations, and a string of waterfront restaurants and bars. On a summer afternoon, this is one of the most pleasant urban walks in the Midwest. Take your time, browse the shops, eat at the market, and soak in the neighborhood.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="travel-card">
          <h3 class="travel-card__title">Lakefront Brewery Tour</h3>
          <p class="travel-card__distance">8 miles</p>
          <p class="travel-card__desc">The Lakefront Brewery tour is the most entertaining brewery tour in America, and that is not an exaggeration. The guided tour is more comedy show than educational lecture, led by enthusiastic guides who keep the energy high with jokes, audience participation, and live polka music. Yes, polka music. You will drink generous samples of Lakefront's excellent beers, learn about the brewing process between laughs, and finish the tour with a token for a full pint at the bar. On Friday nights, the brewery hosts a legendary fish fry -- a Wisconsin tradition -- with fried cod, coleslaw, rye bread, and live polka that turns the tap room into a full-scale celebration. Book the Friday fish fry tour if you can. It is one of the best experiences in Milwaukee.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="travel-card">
          <h3 class="travel-card__title">Milwaukee Art Museum</h3>
          <p class="travel-card__distance">8 miles</p>
          <p class="travel-card__desc">The Milwaukee Art Museum is worth visiting for the building alone. The Quadracci Pavilion, designed by Santiago Calatrava, features a massive brise soleil -- a wing-like sunscreen structure that opens and closes throughout the day like a giant bird spreading its wings over Lake Michigan. It is one of the most photographed buildings in the Midwest and a genuine architectural masterpiece. Inside, the collection spans over 30,000 works, with strengths in American decorative arts, German Expressionism, and folk art. The museum sits directly on the lakefront with sweeping views of Lake Michigan, and admission is free on the first Thursday of every month. Even if you are not an art museum person, the Calatrava building and the lakefront setting make this a must-see.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="travel-card">
          <h3 class="travel-card__title">Harley-Davidson Museum</h3>
          <p class="travel-card__distance">7 miles</p>
          <p class="travel-card__desc">Milwaukee is the birthplace of Harley-Davidson, and the Harley-Davidson Museum tells the story of one of the most iconic American brands ever created. The museum houses over 450 motorcycles and artifacts spanning more than a century of history, from the earliest single-cylinder machines built in a backyard shed to the custom choppers and racing bikes that defined American motorcycle culture. The exhibits are interactive and beautifully curated, with everything from vintage advertising and leather jackets to engines you can touch and bikes you can sit on. You do not need to be a motorcycle enthusiast to be fascinated by this place. The story of Harley-Davidson is the story of American manufacturing, rebellion, freedom, and design, and the museum tells it brilliantly.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="travel-card">
          <h3 class="travel-card__title">Milwaukee County Zoo</h3>
          <p class="travel-card__distance">3 miles</p>
          <p class="travel-card__desc">The Milwaukee County Zoo is one of the finest zoos in the Midwest, spread across more than 200 acres with a diverse collection of animals from around the world. The zoo features large, naturalistic habitats for its residents, from African elephants and gorillas to polar bears, big cats, and a wide variety of birds and reptiles. The grounds are well-maintained and easy to navigate, with plenty of shade and picnic areas that make it a comfortable visit even on a warm summer day. For families with children, the zoo is an obvious pre-game or off-day activity, located just a few miles from American Family Field. It is a well-run, community-supported institution that punches well above what you might expect from a mid-sized city.</p>

      <!-- Getting There -->
      <section class="content-block" aria-labelledby="getting-there">
        <h2 id="getting-there">Getting There</h2>
        <p>American Family Field sits in the Menomonee River Valley just west of downtown Milwaukee, directly accessible from Interstate 94. This is a car-dominant ballpark, and the vast majority of fans arrive by automobile. The stadium is surrounded by massive parking lots -- over 12,000 spaces -- that serve double duty as the stage for the legendary tailgating scene. If you are driving, follow the signs from I-94 and arrive early. The earlier you get there, the better your tailgate spot, and the more time you have to soak in the pre-game atmosphere before first pitch.</p>
        <p>If you prefer not to drive, the Milwaukee County Transit System (MCTS) operates bus routes to the stadium on game days, providing a transit option from downtown and surrounding neighborhoods. Several downtown bars and restaurants also run shuttle services to American Family Field before games, which is a great option if you want to start your evening in the city and avoid parking altogether. Check with popular spots in the Third Ward and downtown for shuttle schedules and availability.</p>
        <p>Rideshare services like Uber and Lyft work well at American Family Field, with designated pickup and drop-off areas that keep things organized. The ride from downtown Milwaukee takes about 10 to 15 minutes depending on game-day traffic. If you are coming from the airport, Mitchell International is only about 10 miles south, making American Family Field one of the more convenient ballparks to visit as part of a fly-in trip.</p>

        <div class="tip-box">
          <p class="tip-box__label">Insider Tips</p>
          <p>Tailgate in the parking lot before the game. This is not optional -- it is the defining experience of American Family Field. Arrive at least two hours before first pitch, fire up a grill or befriend someone who has one, and cook bratwurst in the parking lot alongside thousands of fellow fans. The tailgating at American Family Field is the best in baseball, a genuine bratwurst party that turns the pre-game into an event every bit as memorable as the game itself. If you are visiting from out of town, do not be shy. Brewers fans are extraordinarily welcoming, and you will almost certainly be offered a brat and a beer by your neighbors.</p>
          <p>The sausage race in the bottom of the sixth inning is a must-see. Pick your favorite sausage before the race begins, cheer with everything you have, and enjoy one of the most joyful moments in baseball. The entire stadium gets into it, and it captures the fun, unpretentious spirit of this franchise perfectly.</p>
          <p>Grab a bratwurst inside the park if you did not get your fill in the parking lot, and pair it with a Spotted Cow from New Glarus Brewing. Spotted Cow is a Wisconsin-exclusive farmhouse ale that you cannot buy outside the state, making it one of the most sought-after regional beers in America. Drinking a Spotted Cow at a Brewers game is a quintessential Wisconsin experience, and you will understand why the locals are so protective of it.</p>

        <div class="drawback-box">
          <p class="drawback-box__label">Worth Knowing</p>
          <p>The biggest drawback of American Family Field is its suburban location. The stadium sits off Interstate 94 in the Menomonee River Valley, surrounded by parking lots and highway ramps. There is no walkable neighborhood around the ballpark, no cluster of bars and restaurants just outside the gates, no urban streetscape to explore before or after the game. When you leave the stadium, you walk through a parking lot to your car. The energy of the game-day experience lives inside the park and in the tailgate lots, but it evaporates the moment you step outside that perimeter.</p>
          <p>A car is essentially required to visit American Family Field. While bus routes and bar shuttles exist, the overwhelming majority of fans drive, and the park was designed with that assumption. If you are visiting Milwaukee without a car, plan your transportation carefully. The lack of a dedicated transit line to the stadium is a meaningful inconvenience for visitors who are used to taking a subway or walking from a nearby hotel.</p>
          <p>The area immediately surrounding American Family Field can feel isolated from the city. Downtown Milwaukee, the Third Ward, the lakefront, and the neighborhoods where you would actually want to spend time are all several miles away. The stadium exists in its own world, connected to the city by highway rather than by sidewalk. It is a trade-off -- you get the incredible tailgating culture and the engineering marvel of the retractable roof, but you lose the urban integration that makes some newer ballparks feel like they are woven into the fabric of their city.</p>

            <summary>What should I eat at a Brewers game?</summary>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>The bratwurst is the signature food at American Family Field, and you should absolutely have one. This is Milwaukee, the bratwurst capital of the world, and the brats at the ballpark are excellent -- grilled, snapped into a bun, and topped with stadium mustard and sauerkraut. Beyond the brat, the Brewers have built one of the better concession lineups in baseball. The Wisconsin cheese curds are a must-try for any first-time visitor, served deep-fried and squeaky-fresh. Grab a Spotted Cow from New Glarus Brewing, a beloved Wisconsin craft beer that is only available in the state and has become the unofficial beer of Brewers fans. For something more substantial, look for the pulled pork nachos or the Milwaukee-style frozen custard for dessert. But start with the brat. Always start with the brat.</p>
