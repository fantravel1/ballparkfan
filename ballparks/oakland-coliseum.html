Despite being widely considered one of the worst stadium modifications in sports history, Mt. Davis has become an ironic symbol of the Coliseum itself — ugly, unloved by design purists, but undeniably part of the stadium's identity."

The Coliseum BART station is located directly adjacent to the stadium, connected by a pedestrian bridge that drops you just steps from the gates.

BART runs frequent service from San Francisco, downtown Oakland, Berkeley, and communities throughout the East Bay. You can be at the ballpark in about 20 minutes from downtown San Francisco or 10 minutes from downtown Oakland. On game days, BART runs extended service to accommodate fans after night games. Taking BART also means you avoid the Coliseum's notoriously unpleasant parking situation."

      <!-- What Makes Oakland Coliseum Special -->
      <section class="content-block" aria-labelledby="what-makes-special">
        <h2 id="what-makes-special">What Makes Oakland Coliseum Special</h2>

        <p>The Oakland Coliseum is not pretty. It is not luxurious. It does not have craft cocktail bars or farm-to-table concession stands or a retractable roof. What the Oakland Coliseum has is something no amount of money can buy: authenticity. This is a stadium where the baseball itself has always been the point, where the fans who show up are there because they love the game and their team with an intensity that fancy ballparks cannot manufacture. It is the last of its kind, and it deserves to be remembered for what it was, not what it lacked.</p>

        <h3>The Moneyball Stadium</h3>
        <p>The Oakland Coliseum is the stadium where Moneyball happened. Billy Beane's revolutionary approach to building a competitive team on the smallest budget in baseball did not happen in a gleaming new facility with corporate suites and sponsorship deals. It happened here, in a crumbling concrete bowl surrounded by parking lots, where a front office with no money outsmarted franchises spending three and four times as much. The 2002 team's 20-game winning streak, the foundation of Michael Lewis's book and the Brad Pitt film, unfolded in these seats. The Coliseum is where baseball's analytics revolution was born, and every front office in the sport today owes a debt to what happened in this unglamorous building.</p>

        <h3>The Last True Dual-Use Stadium</h3>
        <p>The Oakland Coliseum was the last stadium in Major League Baseball to serve as a home for both a baseball and a football team. For decades, the A's shared the building with the NFL's Raiders, and the consequences of that arrangement defined the stadium's character. The foul territory is enormous — a remnant of the football configuration — pushing fans farther from the action than at any other ballpark. The sightlines are compromised. The aesthetics suffer. But there is something fascinating about being in the last venue of its kind, a relic of an era when cities built one big concrete bowl and told everyone to make it work.</p>

        <h3>Mt. Davis &mdash; The Beautiful Eyesore</h3>
        <p>In 1996, Oakland added a massive concrete upper deck to lure the Raiders back from Los Angeles. Fans named it Mt. Davis, after Raiders owner Al Davis, and the name was not meant as a compliment. The structure towers over center field like a brutalist monument, completely obliterating the gorgeous view of the Oakland hills that the original 1966 design showcased. It is widely considered one of the worst stadium modifications in sports history. And yet, over the decades, Mt. Davis has become oddly iconic — an unmistakable silhouette that says "Oakland Coliseum" as surely as the Green Monster says Fenway. It is the architectural embodiment of a stadium that has been through it all and keeps standing.</p>

        <h3>The Bleacher Drummers</h3>
        <p>No fan section in baseball sounds like the Oakland Coliseum bleachers. The Bleacher Drummers have been a fixture at A's games for years, banging drums and leading chants that echo through the concrete bowl with a rhythm and energy that puts most stadium DJ-led "entertainment" to shame. The drumming gives A's games a visceral, grassroots atmosphere that feels more like a soccer match in South America than a typical American baseball game. It is organic, loud, unpolished, and completely wonderful. You will hear the drums before you see the field, and the sound will stay with you long after you leave.</p>

        <h3>The Most Affordable MLB Experience</h3>
        <p>The Oakland Coliseum has consistently offered the cheapest tickets in Major League Baseball. On many game days, you could walk up to the window and buy a seat for the price of a sandwich at the ballpark across the bay. For families, for young fans, for anyone who just wants to watch a baseball game without taking out a second mortgage, the Coliseum has been the most democratic venue in the sport. That affordability is part of its soul.</p>

        <h3>Rickey Henderson Field &amp; A Dynasty's Legacy</h3>
        <p>The playing surface at the Oakland Coliseum is named Rickey Henderson Field, honoring the greatest leadoff hitter and base stealer in the history of the game. Henderson is Oakland through and through — brash, confident, singular, and impossible to ignore. Beyond Rickey, the Coliseum is where the A's dynasty of 1972, 1973, and 1974 won three consecutive World Series championships, a feat matched only by the 1936-39 Yankees in the modern era. Reggie Jackson, Catfish Hunter, Rollie Fingers, Vida Blue — these legends played their home games right here. The concrete may be crumbling, but the history embedded in it is Hall of Fame caliber.</p>

        <h3>Raw, Authentic Baseball</h3>
        <p>There is no sugarcoating the Oakland Coliseum, and that is precisely the point. This is a place where the baseball speaks for itself. There are no distractions, no gimmicks, no billion-dollar views designed to make you forget the product on the field. When you sit in the Coliseum, you watch the game. You hear the crack of the bat. You feel the concrete under your feet. You are in a place that has never tried to be anything other than a ballpark. In an era of luxury suites and themed entertainment zones, the Coliseum's stubborn refusal to be anything more than a place to watch baseball has become, paradoxically, its most distinctive feature.</p>

        <h2 id="nearby-attractions">Local Travel</h2>
        <p>Oakland and the East Bay are packed with character, culture, and some of the best food in California. The Coliseum sits in an industrial area south of downtown Oakland, but BART puts the entire region within easy reach. Build your trip around the neighborhoods and attractions that make Oakland one of the most vibrant cities on the West Coast.</p>

        <div class="travel-card">
          <h3 class="travel-card__title">Jack London Square</h3>
          <p class="travel-card__distance">6 miles from Oakland Coliseum</p>
          <p class="travel-card__desc">Oakland's waterfront district is named for the author who spent his formative years here, and it remains one of the city's most enjoyable gathering spots. The farmers market on Sundays is excellent, the waterfront restaurants offer views across the estuary, and Heinold's First and Last Chance Saloon — the tiny, tilting bar where Jack London actually drank and wrote — is one of the most genuinely historic watering holes in California. The floors still slant from the 1906 earthquake. Grab a drink, soak up the waterfront atmosphere, and walk the promenade before heading to the game.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="travel-card">
          <h3 class="travel-card__title">Oakland Museum of California</h3>
          <p class="travel-card__distance">5 miles from Oakland Coliseum</p>
          <p class="travel-card__desc">One of the most underappreciated museums on the West Coast. The Oakland Museum of California covers the art, history, and natural science of the entire state across three floors of beautifully curated galleries. The Gallery of California Art features works from the Gold Rush era to contemporary Bay Area artists. The rooftop sculpture garden offers a peaceful escape with views of Lake Merritt. It is a museum that captures the full sweep of California's story in a way that no San Francisco institution quite matches. Allow at least two hours.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="travel-card">
          <h3 class="travel-card__title">Temescal &amp; Rockridge Neighborhoods</h3>
          <p class="travel-card__distance">7 miles from Oakland Coliseum</p>
          <p class="travel-card__desc">These two adjoining neighborhoods along Telegraph Avenue and College Avenue represent Oakland's dining and culture scene at its best. Bakesale Betty's — the legendary fried chicken sandwich shop where the line out the door is part of the experience — is a Temescal institution. The surrounding blocks are packed with Ethiopian restaurants, Korean barbecue joints, taco trucks, craft breweries, and independent bookstores. Rockridge, accessible directly via BART, adds tree-lined streets, boutique shops, and a farmers market that locals swear by. This is where Oakland eats, and the diversity of the food scene here rivals anything in San Francisco at a fraction of the price.</p>

          <h3 class="travel-card__title">San Francisco via BART</h3>
          <p class="travel-card__distance">20 minutes from Oakland Coliseum</p>
          <p class="travel-card__desc">One of the great advantages of a trip to the Oakland Coliseum is that San Francisco is a 20-minute BART ride away through the Transbay Tube. The entire city is at your disposal — the Golden Gate Bridge, Fisherman's Wharf, the Mission District's legendary burrito corridor, Golden Gate Park, Chinatown, and the cable cars. You can spend your morning walking across the Golden Gate Bridge, your afternoon exploring the Haight or the Castro, and your evening at the Coliseum watching the A's. Few ballpark trips in America offer that kind of two-city flexibility with zero need for a car.</p>

          <p class="travel-card__distance">10 miles from Oakland Coliseum</p>
          <p class="travel-card__desc">Towering coastal redwoods growing within the city limits of Oakland. Redwood Regional Park is one of the East Bay's great natural treasures — a 1,830-acre expanse of second-growth redwood forest threaded with hiking trails that range from easy streamside strolls to strenuous ridge climbs. The trees were logged during the Gold Rush but have regrown magnificently, and walking among them is a powerful reminder that Oakland is not just an urban center but a gateway to extraordinary Northern California landscapes. The Stream Trail is the classic introductory hike. Go in the morning when the fog filters through the canopy.</p>

      <section class="content-block" aria-labelledby="getting-there">
        <h2 id="getting-there">Getting There</h2>
        <p>The Oakland Coliseum has one of the best public transit connections of any ballpark in Major League Baseball, and you should absolutely take advantage of it. BART is the answer.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>BART Coliseum Station:</strong> The Coliseum BART station sits directly adjacent to the stadium, connected by a pedestrian bridge that puts you steps from the gates. It is one of the most seamless transit-to-ballpark connections in all of professional sports. Trains run frequently from San Francisco (about 20 minutes), downtown Oakland (about 10 minutes), Berkeley, and communities throughout the East Bay. On game days, BART runs extended service after night games. This is the way to go.</li>
          <li><strong>Driving &amp; I-880:</strong> The Coliseum is located just off Interstate 880, the main north-south freeway through the East Bay. Access is straightforward, but game-day traffic on I-880 and the surrounding surface streets can be heavy. If you drive, expect delays getting in and out.</li>
          <li><strong>Parking:</strong> Large surface parking lots surround the Coliseum complex. Parking is generally available and more affordable than at most MLB stadiums. However, the lots are vast, poorly lit in some areas, and the post-game exit can be slow. BART eliminates all of these concerns.</li>

          <p>The Oakland Coliseum has consistently offered the cheapest tickets in Major League Baseball. If you are looking for the most affordable way to watch a big league game, this is it. Walk-up tickets on non-premium game days have been available for as little as ten or fifteen dollars. For the price of a single ticket at some East Coast ballparks, you could take your whole family to the Coliseum.</p>
          <p>Take BART. Seriously. The Coliseum BART station is right there, the connection is effortless, and you avoid every headache associated with driving and parking. It is one of the few MLB stadiums where public transit is genuinely the best option, not just an alternative. Ride the train, walk the bridge, and you are at the gates in minutes.</p>
          <p>The bleacher sections are where the energy lives. If you want the full Oakland Coliseum experience — the drummers, the chants, the passion — sit in the bleachers. This is where the diehards gather, where the atmosphere is loudest, and where the spirit of Oakland baseball is most alive. It is not a luxury experience. It is better than that.</p>
          <p>Bring your own personality. The Oakland Coliseum rewards fans who show up as themselves. This is not a see-and-be-seen ballpark. Nobody cares what you are wearing. The crowd is diverse, unpretentious, and fiercely loyal. Come as you are, cheer loud, and you will fit right in.</p>

        <h2 id="honest-drawbacks">Honest Drawbacks</h2>
        <div class="drawback-box">
          <p class="drawback-box__label">Worth Knowing</p>
          <p>The Oakland Coliseum is aging and it shows. The concrete is weathered, the facilities are dated, and the overall condition of the stadium reflects decades of deferred maintenance and underinvestment. Restrooms, concourses, and seating areas all carry the wear of a building that has been patched rather than renovated. If you are accustomed to the gleaming amenities of newer ballparks, the Coliseum will feel rough around the edges — because it is.</p>
          <p>Mt. Davis, the massive concrete upper deck added in 1996, completely blocks the Oakland hills view that was the original stadium's most beautiful feature. What was once an open, airy ballpark with rolling green hills beyond the outfield is now a closed-off concrete bowl. The aesthetic damage is real, and longtime fans have never forgiven it.</p>
          <p>Sewage backups have happened at the Oakland Coliseum. This is not an urban legend or an exaggeration — raw sewage has overflowed into the dugouts and clubhouse on multiple documented occasions. It is one of the most embarrassing infrastructure failures in modern professional sports, and while it does not happen every game, the fact that it has happened at all tells you everything about the state of the building's plumbing.</p>
          <p>The Oakland Athletics are relocating. The team's departure from Oakland means the Coliseum's future as a major league venue is over. The uncertainty surrounding the franchise — years of relocation rumors, dwindling attendance, an ownership group that seemed to stop investing in the stadium long ago — has cast a shadow over the fan experience for years. If you are visiting, you are witnessing the end of an era.</p>
          <p>The foul territory at the Oakland Coliseum is enormous — a legacy of the stadium's dual-use football and baseball configuration. This means that seats behind home plate and along the baselines are significantly farther from the action than at virtually any other MLB park. Foul balls that would land in the front rows at most stadiums die harmlessly in the vast expanse of foul ground at the Coliseum. It affects the intimacy of the experience in a real way.</p>

            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>Yes. The Oakland Athletics have announced plans to relocate from Oakland. After decades of failed stadium negotiations in the Bay Area, the team ownership committed to moving. The departure marks the end of an era that stretches back to 1968, encompassing four World Series titles, the Moneyball revolution, and some of the most passionate fans in baseball history. The Oakland Coliseum's future as a major league venue has effectively ended, making any remaining games there a farewell to one of baseball's most storied and gritty homes.</p>

            <summary>What is Mt. Davis at the Oakland Coliseum?</summary>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>Mt. Davis is the massive concrete upper deck that was added to the Oakland Coliseum in 1996 to accommodate the return of the NFL's Oakland Raiders. Named derisively by fans after Raiders owner Al Davis, the structure towers over center field and completely blocks what was once a beautiful view of the Oakland hills. Mt. Davis added roughly 20,000 seats to the stadium but destroyed the open, airy feel of the original 1966 design. The seats in Mt. Davis were rarely filled for baseball games and were often tarped off. Despite being widely considered one of the worst stadium modifications in sports history, Mt. Davis has become an ironic symbol of the Coliseum itself — ugly, unloved by design purists, but undeniably part of the stadium's identity.</p>

            <summary>Can you take BART to the Oakland Coliseum?</summary>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>Yes, and BART is by far the best way to get to the Oakland Coliseum. The Coliseum BART station is located directly adjacent to the stadium, connected by a pedestrian bridge that drops you just steps from the gates. It is one of the most convenient transit connections of any ballpark in Major League Baseball. BART runs frequent service from San Francisco, downtown Oakland, Berkeley, and communities throughout the East Bay. You can be at the ballpark in about 20 minutes from downtown San Francisco or 10 minutes from downtown Oakland. On game days, BART runs extended service to accommodate fans after night games. Taking BART also means you avoid the Coliseum's notoriously unpleasant parking situation.</p>
